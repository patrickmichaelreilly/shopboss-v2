## **Phase B: Billboard Implementation & Error Visibility (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Objective:** Make existing billboards always visible on Assembly and Sorting stations

**Target Files:**
- Frontend: Assembly.cshtml, Sorting.cshtml (only these two)
- Backend: AssemblyController.cs, SortingController.cs (only these two)
- Component: _BillboardMessage.cshtml (already exists and well-implemented)

**Tasks:**
1. **Remove Auto-Hide from Existing Billboard Component (15 min)**
   - _BillboardMessage.cshtml: Remove auto-hide parameter and logic
   - Remove close button from billboard actions
   - Ensure messages persist until replaced by new ones

2. **Remove Auto-Hide from Station Views (15 min)**
   - Assembly.cshtml: Remove any auto-hide JavaScript calls
   - Sorting.cshtml: Remove any auto-hide JavaScript calls  
   - Ensure billboard containers are always visible (no display:none)
   - Move billboard to display at bottom of view right above footer for now

3. **Basic Message Framework Enhancement (30 min)**
   - AssemblyController: Ensure billboard messages are sent properly
   - SortingController: Ensure billboard messages are sent properly
   - Simple message passing - no complex validation logic yet
   - Focus on framework, not detailed error scenarios

4. **Testing Framework (15 min)**
   - Verify messages appear and persist
   - Test message replacement functionality
   - Confirm no auto-hide behavior or close buttons

**Validation:**

**Tasks:**
1. **Analyze Hardware Quantity Patterns (45 min)**
   - Document duplicated entities (Quantity = 1, multiple records)
   - Document single entities with Quantity > 1 attribute
   - Identify current import normalization behavior
   - Create test cases for both patterns

2. **Implement Hardware Grouping Logic (1.5 hours)**
   - Create service to handle both quantity patterns gracefully
   - Group by hardware type/description
   - Calculate total quantities correctly for both patterns
   - Handle edge cases (mixed patterns for same hardware type)

3. **Create Bundled Hardware UI (1 hour)**
   - Design hardware group display in Shipping Station
   - Show grouped hardware with total quantities
   - Add "mark all as shipped" functionality for bundles
   - Implement individual item override if needed

4. **Integration and Testing (45 min)**
   - Test with both quantity patterns extensively
   - Verify shipping operations work correctly
   - Test edge cases and mixed scenarios
   - Document pattern for potential Assembly Station use

**Validation:**
- [ ] Hardware groups correctly regardless of quantity pattern
- [ ] Total quantities calculated accurately
- [ ] Bundle shipping works for all hardware types
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Pattern documented for future use

**Dependencies:** Phase B complete (for error visibility during testing)

## **Timeline Estimate**

**Phase B:** 1.25 hours (billboard persistence + basic messaging)  
**Phase H:** 4 hours (hardware grouping with dual quantity handling)  
**Phase F:** 10 hours (comprehensive view-by-view polish)

**Total to Beta:** ~15.25 hours over 2-3 weeks

**Parallel work:** User testing edge cases during Phase H implementation

---

## **Risk Mitigation**

1. **Billboard visibility first**: Exposes real issues before final polish
2. **Hardware grouping isolated**: Prove pattern in Shipping before expanding
3. **Incremental delivery**: Each phase builds on previous success
4. **User feedback integration**: Edge case testing parallel to development
5. **Preserve all existing functionality**: No regression in working systems

This phases document prioritizes visibility and feedback (billboards) to drive discovery of real issues, implements hardware grouping carefully with dual quantity pattern support, and finishes with comprehensive polish. The focus is on:

1. **Making problems visible** through persistent billboard messaging
2. **Solving complex grouping** with careful attention to quantity patterns  
3. **Professional polish** across all views for beta readiness
4. **Maintaining stability** of the working Phase M foundation
