# ShopBoss v2 Production Phases - Path to Beta

**Current State:** Phase M1 in progress, core functionality complete  
**Strategy:** Complete current work, fix critical bugs, polish for beta, defer major refactoring

---

## **Phase M: Manual Override Completion (3-4 hours + station migrations)**
*Finish what we started - includes targeted refactoring*

### **M1: Complete ModifyWorkOrder Interface with TreeViewApi (2-3 hours)**
**Replace old ModifyWorkOrder with the current StatusManagement panel (renamed to ModifyWorkOrder)**

### **Context: Import System Alignment Crisis**
After successfully completing Phase M1 (Status Management/ModifyWorkOrder interface), we attempted to proceed with the M1.x phases for Status field unification. However, a critical issue emerged: The Import Preview system was still using the old view patterns and wasn't aligned with the new Status-based architecture implemented in ModifyWorkOrder. When Claude Code noticed this discrepancy, it attempted to fix the mismatch by modifying the AdminController to handle mixed states between old and new patterns. This was the WRONG approach - it created more complexity instead of systematically migrating components.

### **M1.5: Fix Import System FIRST (1 hour)**
**Fix the Import process to work with current Status implementation**

**CRITICAL:** This phase must be completed BEFORE any database migrations. The Import system must be able to create entities with proper Status fields.

### **M1.6: Database Migration for Status Unification (1 hour)**
**Add Status fields to all entities, migrate data, but keep old properties temporarily**

### **M1.7: CNC Station Status Migration (1 hour)**
**Migrate CNC station from IsProcessed to Status**

### **M1.8: Assembly Station Status Migration (1.5 hours)**
**Migrate Assembly station from IsCompleted to Status**

### **M1.9: Shipping Station Status Migration (2 hours)**
**Migrate Shipping station from IsShipped to Status**

### **M1.10: Final Cleanup and Old Property Removal (1 hour)**
**Remove all obsolete properties after all stations migrated**

**Success = All workflows function with Status enum only**

### **M1.x-EMERGENCY: Migration Consolidation Crisis (PRIORITY)**
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** 2 days wasted on migration failures, token consumption crisis threatening entire project

### **M2: Status Management Cascade Logic (2 hours)**
**Add comprehensive cascading logic for shop foreman override capabilities**

**Objective:** Grant shop foreman complete control over all entity statuses with intelligent cascade operations across hierarchical structures.

**Tasks:**
1. Remove unused `UpdateEntityStatus()` method and `UpdateStatusRequest` class
2. Implement comprehensive cascade operations for hierarchical status changes
3. Add cascade UI controls to ModifyWorkOrder interface
4. Enhance existing cascade logic to support all directions (up/down hierarchy)
5. Test cascading operations across all entity types

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Complete status override capabilities (any entity to any status)
- ✅ Intelligent cascade operations across work order hierarchy
- ✅ Clean AdminController with unused methods removed
- ✅ Enhanced ModifyWorkOrder interface with cascade controls

### **M3: Integration Testing (1 hour)**
**Ensure Manual Override system is production ready**

**Tasks:**
1. Test status changes cascade properly
2. Verify audit trail captures all changes
3. Test undo functionality (if implemented)
4. Ensure SignalR updates work across stations
5. Document any limitations or known issues

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Manual override fully functional
- ✅ All edge cases handled
- ✅ Ready for production use

## **Phase B: Critical Bug Fixes (4-5 hours)**
*Address high-priority issues from Bugs.md*

### **B1: Station-Critical Fixes (2 hours)**
1. **Sorting Station**: Fix duplicate "Ready for Assembly" alerts
2. **Sorting Station**: Fix manual "Sort" buttons in Cut Parts Modal
3. **Assembly Station**: Remove Sorting Rack statistics box completely
4. **Universal Scanner**: Remove help button
5. **Rack Configuration**: Add cascade rules for non-empty rack deletion

### **B2: Import & Data Fixes (2 hours)**
1. **Import Process**: Handle duplicate Work Order Names/IDs properly
2. **Hardware Grouping**: Combine identical hardware in Assembly/Shipping stations
3. **Work Order List**: Fix star icon column layout (dedicated column, remove from name)
4. **Navigation**: Remove ALL Microvellum branding from footer and elsewhere

### **B3: UI Polish from Bugs.md (1 hour)**
1. **Sorting Station**: Add billboard area, improve grid visualization
2. **Sorting Station**: Increase rack grid size, remove labels, better color coding
3. **Assembly Station**: Decrease vertical size of list items
4. **Shipping Station**: Implement bundled hardware shipping

## **Phase E: Error Handling & Messaging (3-4 hours)**
*Production-ready error management*

### **E1: Error Matrix Development (1 hour)**
**Define all error scenarios and responses**

Create comprehensive error handling matrix for:
- Scanner errors (invalid barcode, network issues)
- Status transition violations
- Data integrity issues
- Concurrent user conflicts
- Part already scanned/sorted scenarios

### **E2: Billboard Implementation (2 hours)**
**Persistent error display for critical stations**

Implement billboard messaging for:
- Sorting Station (part already scanned, bin full, wrong rack)
- Assembly Station (missing parts, wrong sequence)
- CNC Station (nest sheet already processed)
- Clear recovery instructions for each error

### **E3: Toast & Notification Polish (1 hour)**
**Temporary notifications and success feedback**

- Success confirmations with appropriate duration
- Warning toasts for non-critical issues
- Info notifications for system events
- Consistent styling and positioning

## **Phase U: UI Polish & Production Readiness (4-5 hours)**
*Final interface refinements - partially complete*

### **U1: Complete Billboard Integration (1 hour)**
**Wire up the billboard messages that were created but not fully integrated**

**Tasks:**
1. **Sorting Station Billboard Integration**
   - Wire up "Part already scanned" errors to billboard
   - Show "Bin full" warnings in billboard
   - Display "Wrong rack selected" messages
   - Show "Ready for Assembly" notifications

2. **Assembly Station Billboard Integration**

   - Test persistent vs auto-hide scenarios

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Billboard shows actual station messages (not empty)

## **Timeline Estimate**

**Week 1:** Complete Phase M + High Priority Bugs (Phase B1-B2)  
**Week 2:** Error Handling + Remaining Bugs (Phase E + B3)  
**Week 3:** UI Polish + Testing (Phase U + V1)  
**Week 4:** Beta Release Prep (Phase V2)

**Total to Beta:** ~18-22 hours over 4 weeks

**Post-Beta:** Architecture refactoring as time permits

---

## **Risk Mitigation**

1. **Focus on beta**: Defer non-critical refactoring
2. **Test thoroughly**: Each bug fix verified before moving on
3. **Incremental delivery**: Complete phases before starting new ones
4. **User feedback**: Early beta testing to catch issues

This phases document prioritizes getting to beta with a stable, functional system. Major refactoring is deferred until after beta success is confirmed. The focus is on:

1. **Completing current work** (Phase M with targeted AdminController cleanup)
2. **Fixing user-facing bugs** that would block beta adoption
3. **Adding essential error handling** for production use
4. **Polish and testing** for professional deployment
5. **Deferring major refactoring** until post-beta
