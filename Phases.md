## **Risk Mitigation & Contingency**

### **High-Risk Items:**
1. **Scanner Interface Integration** - Test early, have fallback UI controls
2. **Self-Monitoring Complexity** - Implement incrementally, start with basic checks
3. **Performance Under Load** - Profile early, optimize query patterns

### **Time Buffer Recommendations:**
- Add 20% time buffer for each phase
- Prioritize core functionality over polish if time constrained
- Phase D (UI Polish) can be shortened if needed

---

## **Post-Beta Roadmap Consideration**

### **Future Enhancements Identified:**
1. **Configurable Workflows** - Arbitrary status paths for different processes
2. **Edgebanding Integration** - Additional manufacturing process support
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Production metrics and reporting
4. **Multi-Location Support** - Scale to multiple facilities
