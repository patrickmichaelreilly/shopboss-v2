# ShopBoss Manifesto

## The Problem with Software for Small Shops

Most business software is built by programmers who've never done the actual work. They try to capture domain knowledge through meetings and specifications, losing the crucial details that make the difference between software that helps and software that gets in the way.

Small shops end up buying generic solutions and adapting their processes to fit the software, instead of the other way around. Or they stick with spreadsheets because custom software seems impossibly expensive.

## Building Tools Like We Build Jigs

In the shop, when a standard clamp doesn't work for our setup, we make one that does. When we need a specific jig for a recurring operation, we build it. We don't call a jig company and try to explain our process through three intermediaries.

Software should work the same way. The person who knows the work best should be able to build the tools directly.

## AI Changes the Game

AI doesn't replace programmers - it makes domain experts into programmers. Now the same person who understands the nuanced workflow can build software that captures it accurately. No knowledge gets lost in translation because there is no translation.

With AI assistance, we can build custom tools as naturally as we build custom fixtures. Iterate quickly, test on real work, refine based on actual use.

## The Operating System for the Shop

ShopBoss isn't just another business app. It's infrastructure - an operating system that coordinates all the digital tools we need, designed around how we actually work rather than how software companies think we should work.

It captures the tribal knowledge, automates the repetitive stuff, and guides people through better processes just by using it. The software embodies expertise instead of fighting it.

## Why This Matters

Every shop has unique processes, materials, equipment, and workflows. Cookie-cutter software forces compromises that add friction to daily work. Custom software removes that friction and lets us focus on making great products.

We're not trying to revolutionize manufacturing. We're just building better tools for the work we're already doing, using the same craftsman approach we bring to everything else in the shop.
