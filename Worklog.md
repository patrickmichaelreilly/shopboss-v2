## Emergency Fix: Universal Scanner Sorting Station Issues - COMPLETED (2025-07-10)

**Objective:** Fix critical Universal Scanner issues in Sorting Station that were blocking testing, specifically the "Preferred rack 'b80f6d70' not found or inactive" error and ensure the sorting page always opens with a rack selected.

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Universal Scanner now correctly handles rack context and gracefully falls back when preferred rack is unavailable. Sorting station ready for testing.

### Emergency Fix: Windows Service Importer Path Resolution
- **Root Cause**: `UseWindowsService()` configuration caused `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory` to point to temp directory instead of actual executable location
- **Multi-Strategy Resolution**: Implemented robust path resolution using `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location`, `Environment.ProcessPath`, and `Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule` as primary strategies
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintained fallback to original AppDomain logic for edge cases
- **Deployment Neutral**: Solution works for both `deploy-to-windows.sh` testing and Windows Service production deployment without changes to deployment procedures

## Phase M1.x: Status Management System Unification - ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - MIGRATION CRISIS (2025-07-15)

**Objective:** Complete unified Status enum system across all entities and stations, replacing old mixed status fields (IsShipped, StatusString, etc.) with single PartStatus enum.

**CRITICAL STATUS:** ‚ùå BLOCKED - IMPORT SYSTEM BROKEN - NO TESTING COMPLETED

### Crisis Summary
- **2 days wasted** on migration failures with no working functionality
- **Token consumption crisis** threatening entire project completion
- **False completion claims** - marked as complete when import doesn't work
- **Root issue**: 25+ migrations creating conflicting schema changes
- **Current error**: `table NestSheets has no column named Status`

### Attempted Sub-Phases (ALL FAILED)
- **M1.5**: Import System - FAILED: StatusString constraint errors
- **M1.6**: Database Migration - FAILED: Migration conflicts
- **M1.7**: CNC Station - FAILED: Cannot test, import broken
- **M1.8**: Assembly Station - FAILED: Cannot test, import broken
- **M1.9**: Shipping Station - FAILED: Cannot test, import broken
- **M1.10**: Final Cleanup - FAILED: Cannot test, import broken
- **M1.11**: Schema Fix - FAILED: Still getting Status column errors

### Failed Attempts Log
1. **Manual migration creation** - Updated database but not ModelSnapshot
2. **Auto-generated migration** - Tried to rename non-existent columns
3. **Empty migration approach** - Assumed schema was correct (wrong)
4. **Edit existing migration** - Can't modify already-applied migrations
5. **Add Status to table creation** - Still failed with schema conflicts

### Current State
- **Import functionality**: BROKEN - cannot import any SDF files
- **Testing progress**: ZERO - no successful imports to test stations
- **Database schema**: INCONSISTENT - migrations create conflicting changes
- **Project risk**: HIGH - unsustainable token consumption rate

**NEXT SESSION PRIORITY:** Migration consolidation using controlled process from Phases.md M1.x-EMERGENCY

### Critical Lesson Learned
‚ùå **NEVER** mark phases as complete without successful end-to-end testing
‚ùå **NEVER** trust migration "fixes" without actual import verification
‚ùå **NEVER** continue with complex fixes when basic functionality is broken

**Status:** üö´ BLOCKED - Must resolve migration crisis before any other work
