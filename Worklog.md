## Emergency Fix: Universal Scanner Sorting Station Issues - COMPLETED (2025-07-10)

**Objective:** Fix critical Universal Scanner issues in Sorting Station that were blocking testing, specifically the "Preferred rack 'b80f6d70' not found or inactive" error and ensure the sorting page always opens with a rack selected.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Invalid Rack ID**: Universal Scanner was passing invalid rack IDs to the sorting logic due to parsing errors in `getCurrentlySelectedRackId()`
- **No Default Rack Selection**: Sorting page could open without any rack selected, causing undefined behavior
- **Rigid Error Handling**: SortingRuleService would fail completely when preferred rack wasn't found instead of graceful fallback

### Fixes Implemented
- **Enhanced Rack ID Parsing**: Fixed `getCurrentlySelectedRackId()` to properly parse rack IDs from tab elements and include fallback to global `currentRackId`
- **Guaranteed Rack Selection**: Modified sorting page initialization to ensure first available rack is always selected and activated on page load
- **Graceful Fallback Logic**: Updated SortingRuleService to fall back to standard sorting logic when preferred rack is invalid instead of failing
- **Improved Error Messages**: Enhanced error messages to provide better guidance when rack selection fails
- **Debug Logging**: Added console debugging to track rack ID selection and sorting request parameters

### Technical Changes
- **SortingRuleService.cs**: Added fallback logic in `FindOptimalBinForPartAsync()` when preferred rack is not found
- **Sorting/Index.cshtml**: Enhanced rack tab initialization and `getCurrentlySelectedRackId()` function
- **Enhanced Rack Tab Logic**: Ensured first rack is always marked as active with proper fallback mechanisms

### Business Logic Preservation
- **Carcass Part Grouping**: Maintained existing logic where carcass parts prefer currently displayed rack for grouping
- **Specialized Routing**: Preserved specialized routing for doors, drawer fronts, and adjustable shelves
- **Product Grouping**: Continued grouping parts by product when same product already has parts in a rack

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Universal Scanner now correctly handles rack context and gracefully falls back when preferred rack is unavailable. Sorting station ready for testing.

## Phase C4: Universal Scanner Architecture Refactoring - COMPLETED (2025-07-10)

**Objective:** Refactor Universal Scanner to be a pure input component that emits events, with each page handling scans using existing station-specific logic.

- **Event-Based Architecture**: Clean separation between presentation (scanner) and business logic (stations)
- **Station Integration Pattern**: Standardized event handling pattern across all stations
- **Content-Type Fixes**: All station requests now use correct `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

### Major Bug Fixes Applied
1. **Duplicate Event Emission**: Fixed Universal Scanner dispatching events twice (container + document)
2. **Content-Type Mismatch**: Fixed CNC controller expecting form data but receiving JSON
3. **Duplicate Recent Scans**: Removed duplicate entry creation from `showScanResult()` method
4. **Event Listener Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup to prevent duplicate listeners between page navigations

### Station Refactoring Completed
- **CNC Station**: Integrated with `ProcessNestSheet` endpoint using Phase C4 pattern
- **Sorting Station**: Integrated with `ScanPart` endpoint, removed old scan modal and buttons
- **Assembly Station**: Integrated with `ScanPartForAssembly` endpoint, removed old scan functions
- **Shipping Station**: Integrated with sequential endpoint attempts (Product‚ÜíPart‚ÜíHardware‚ÜíDetachedProduct)
- **Admin Station**: Removed unnecessary scanner references (admin doesn't need scanning)

### Implementation Pattern Documentation
- **Station Integration Pattern**: Documented reusable code template in Phases.md
- **ViewData Configuration**: Standardized Universal Scanner configuration
- **Critical Testing Checklist**: Created comprehensive testing requirements for each station
- **Event Handler Cleanup**: Documented proper beforeunload cleanup pattern

- **Multi-Strategy Resolution**: Implemented robust path resolution using `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location`, `Environment.ProcessPath`, and `Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule` as primary strategies
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintained fallback to original AppDomain logic for edge cases
- **Deployment Neutral**: Solution works for both `deploy-to-windows.sh` testing and Windows Service production deployment without changes to deployment procedures

  - üì¶ **Grey Archive**: Archived Work Orders (when toggle enabled)
- **Archive Actions**: Archive/unarchive buttons with appropriate state management and tooltips
- **Status Column Removal**: Eliminated confusing "Active/Archived" status column to avoid terminology conflicts

### Business Rules & Protection
- **Active Work Order Protection**: Cannot archive currently active (in-service) work order
- **Active Parts Protection**: Cannot archive work orders with unshipped parts or detached products  
- **Session Management**: Clear error messaging when attempting to archive active work order
- **Full Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all archive/unarchive operations via AuditTrailService

- **Button Consistency**: Fixed layout shifting by maintaining 4-button groups with disabled states
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear icons and tooltips indicate work order state and available actions
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive validation prevents invalid archive operations

### Bug Fix: Modify Work Order Status Reversion
- **Root Cause**: Automatic tree refresh after status changes was loading stale data before database commits
- **Solution**: Implemented smart refresh logic that only refreshes when cascading is needed (products with child parts)
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls while maintaining data consistency
- **User Experience**: Part and DetachedProduct status changes now stick immediately without reversion

### Technical Quality
- **Code Standards**: Following established patterns with proper error handling and logging
