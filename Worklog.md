## Phase A1: Work Order Archiving System - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

**Objective:** Implement enterprise-level work order archiving functionality with protection against archiving active work orders and comprehensive UI controls.

### Database Infrastructure
- **Schema Changes**: Added `IsArchived` (bool, default false) and `ArchivedDate` (DateTime?) fields to WorkOrder model
- **Migration Applied**: EF Core migration successfully created and applied for archive fields
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing work orders automatically default to non-archived state

### Service Layer Implementation
- **Archive Methods**: New `ArchiveWorkOrderAsync()` and `UnarchiveWorkOrderAsync()` methods in WorkOrderService
- **Business Logic Protection**: `IsWorkOrderActiveAsync()` method prevents archiving work orders with unshipped parts/detached products
- **Enhanced Queries**: Updated `GetWorkOrderSummariesAsync()` with `includeArchived` parameter for filtered retrieval
- **Data Model Updates**: Extended `WorkOrderSummary` class to include archive status and date fields

### Admin Interface Enhancements
- **Archive Filter Toggle**: "Show Archived" switch with persistent state across search operations
- **Consistent Button Layout**: All work order rows now display exactly 4 action buttons with disabled states for consistency
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Implemented consistent icon system:
  - 🌟 **Yellow Star**: Active Work Order (currently in service)
  - ⭐ **Grey Star**: Inactive Work Orders (available but not in service)
  - 📦 **Grey Archive**: Archived Work Orders (when toggle enabled)
- **Archive Actions**: Archive/unarchive buttons with appropriate state management and tooltips
- **Status Column Removal**: Eliminated confusing "Active/Archived" status column to avoid terminology conflicts

### Business Rules & Protection
- **Active Work Order Protection**: Cannot archive currently active (in-service) work order
- **Active Parts Protection**: Cannot archive work orders with unshipped parts or detached products  
- **Session Management**: Clear error messaging when attempting to archive active work order
- **Full Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all archive/unarchive operations via AuditTrailService
- **SignalR Integration**: Real-time notifications for archive status changes across stations

### User Experience Improvements
- **Smart Filtering**: Default view hides archived work orders, toggle reveals them
- **Search Persistence**: Archive filter state maintained during search operations
- **Button Consistency**: Fixed layout shifting by maintaining 4-button groups with disabled states
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear icons and tooltips indicate work order state and available actions
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive validation prevents invalid archive operations

### Bug Fix: Modify Work Order Status Reversion
- **Root Cause**: Automatic tree refresh after status changes was loading stale data before database commits
- **Solution**: Implemented smart refresh logic that only refreshes when cascading is needed (products with child parts)
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls while maintaining data consistency
- **User Experience**: Part and DetachedProduct status changes now stick immediately without reversion

### Technical Quality
- **Code Standards**: Following established patterns with proper error handling and logging
- **Database Integrity**: All operations properly transactional with rollback support
- **API Consistency**: JSON responses with standardized success/error messaging
- **Frontend Reliability**: Robust JavaScript with proper fetch error handling

**Status: Ready for Testing** - All deliverables completed according to Phase A1 specifications. Archive functionality provides enterprise-level work order lifecycle management.

**Status: Ready for Testing** - All Phase A2 deliverables completed. Backup system provides enterprise-level data protection with automated scheduling, compression, and comprehensive management interface.

### SQLite Backup Fix (Post-Testing)
- **Issue**: SQLite file locking error when creating backups while database is active
- **Root Cause**: File copying doesn't work with active SQLite connections and WAL files
- **Solution**: Implemented SQLite `VACUUM INTO` command for safe backup creation
- **Final Improvements**: 
  - Uses SQLite `VACUUM INTO` command which works with active connections and WAL files
  - Leverages existing EF Core connection instead of creating new file connections
  - Temporary file handling with retry logic for proper cleanup
  - Maintains compatibility with both compressed and uncompressed backups
  - Updated restore functionality to use proper SQLite connection management

- **Health Events Removal**: Removed Recent Health Events logging from HealthMonitoringService as per user request
- **Dashboard Cleanup**: Removed Recent Health Events section from HealthDashboard view to focus on real-time metrics only

### Health Monitoring Preservation
- **Real-time Metrics**: Maintained full health monitoring with real-time dashboard functionality
- **Background Service**: HealthMonitoringService continues running with adaptive monitoring frequency
