# ShopBoss v2 Development Worklog (Condensed)

## Project Overview
ShopBoss v2 is a modern shop floor tracking system replacing the discontinued Production Coach software. Built with ASP.NET Core 8.0, Entity Framework Core 9.0.0, SQLite database, SignalR real-time updates, and Bootstrap 5 UI for millwork manufacturing workflow management.

**Architecture:** MVC pattern with hierarchical data import from Microvellum SDF files, supporting workflow: CNC cutting → Sorting → Assembly → Shipping.

## Phase 2: Data Import & Tree Preview - COMPLETED (2025-06-18-19)

**Objective:** Integrate x86 importer executable with real-time progress and interactive tree preview.

### Major Breakthrough: Infinite Recursion Resolution
