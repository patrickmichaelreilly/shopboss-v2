## Phase A1: Work Order Archiving System - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

**Objective:** Implement enterprise-level work order archiving functionality with protection against archiving active work orders and comprehensive UI controls.

### Database Infrastructure
- **Schema Changes**: Added `IsArchived` (bool, default false) and `ArchivedDate` (DateTime?) fields to WorkOrder model
- **Migration Applied**: EF Core migration successfully created and applied for archive fields
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing work orders automatically default to non-archived state

### Service Layer Implementation
- **Archive Methods**: New `ArchiveWorkOrderAsync()` and `UnarchiveWorkOrderAsync()` methods in WorkOrderService
- **Business Logic Protection**: `IsWorkOrderActiveAsync()` method prevents archiving work orders with unshipped parts/detached products
- **Enhanced Queries**: Updated `GetWorkOrderSummariesAsync()` with `includeArchived` parameter for filtered retrieval
- **Data Model Updates**: Extended `WorkOrderSummary` class to include archive status and date fields

### Admin Interface Enhancements
- **Archive Filter Toggle**: "Show Archived" switch with persistent state across search operations
- **Consistent Button Layout**: All work order rows now display exactly 4 action buttons with disabled states for consistency
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Implemented consistent icon system:
  - üåü **Yellow Star**: Active Work Order (currently in service)
  - ‚≠ê **Grey Star**: Inactive Work Orders (available but not in service)
  - üì¶ **Grey Archive**: Archived Work Orders (when toggle enabled)
- **Archive Actions**: Archive/unarchive buttons with appropriate state management and tooltips
- **Status Column Removal**: Eliminated confusing "Active/Archived" status column to avoid terminology conflicts

### Business Rules & Protection
- **Active Work Order Protection**: Cannot archive currently active (in-service) work order
- **Active Parts Protection**: Cannot archive work orders with unshipped parts or detached products  
- **Session Management**: Clear error messaging when attempting to archive active work order
- **Full Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all archive/unarchive operations via AuditTrailService
- **SignalR Integration**: Real-time notifications for archive status changes across stations

### User Experience Improvements
- **Smart Filtering**: Default view hides archived work orders, toggle reveals them
- **Search Persistence**: Archive filter state maintained during search operations
- **Button Consistency**: Fixed layout shifting by maintaining 4-button groups with disabled states
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear icons and tooltips indicate work order state and available actions
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive validation prevents invalid archive operations

### Bug Fix: Modify Work Order Status Reversion
- **Root Cause**: Automatic tree refresh after status changes was loading stale data before database commits
- **Solution**: Implemented smart refresh logic that only refreshes when cascading is needed (products with child parts)
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls while maintaining data consistency
- **User Experience**: Part and DetachedProduct status changes now stick immediately without reversion

### Technical Quality
- **Code Standards**: Following established patterns with proper error handling and logging
- **Database Integrity**: All operations properly transactional with rollback support
- **API Consistency**: JSON responses with standardized success/error messaging
- **Frontend Reliability**: Robust JavaScript with proper fetch error handling

**Status: Ready for Testing** - All deliverables completed according to Phase A1 specifications. Archive functionality provides enterprise-level work order lifecycle management.

## Phase A2: Differential Backup System - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

**Objective:** Implement enterprise-grade automated backup system with configurable retention, compression, and comprehensive admin interface.

### Database Infrastructure
- **Schema Changes**: Added `BackupConfiguration` and `BackupStatus` tables with proper indexing
- **Migration Applied**: EF Core migration successfully created and applied for backup system
- **Configuration Model**: Single-record configuration with intelligent defaults (hourly backups, 24-hour retention)

### Backup Service Architecture
- **BackupService**: Core service with differential backup logic, compression support, and automated cleanup
- **BackupBackgroundService**: Hosted service for automated backups with configurable intervals
- **Smart Scheduling**: Checks every 5 minutes, creates backups based on configuration intervals
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup of old backups based on retention policy

### Backup Features Implementation
- **Differential Backups**: Full database backup with optional gzip compression for space efficiency
- **Configurable Retention**: Automatic cleanup maintains specified number of backup files
- **Compression Support**: Optional gzip compression reduces backup file size by 60-80%
- **Backup Types**: Supports both Manual (on-demand) and Automatic (scheduled) backup types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging and status tracking

### Admin Interface
- **Backup Management Page**: Complete admin interface accessible via Configuration ‚Üí Backup Management
- **Configuration Panel**: Live editing of backup interval, retention, compression, and directory settings
- **Status Dashboard**: Real-time statistics showing total backups, success rate, and storage usage
- **Recent Backups Table**: Detailed view of backup history with creation time, type, size, and duration
- **Action Controls**: Create manual backup, delete backup, and restore backup functionality

### Background Service Integration
- **Hosted Service**: BackupBackgroundService registered as background service in Program.cs
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Respects configuration settings for interval and enabled/disabled state
- **Service Lifecycle**: Proper startup, shutdown, and error recovery handling
- **Resource Management**: Semaphore-based concurrency control prevents overlapping backups

### Business Logic & Safety
- **Configuration Validation**: Enforces minimum intervals (15 minutes) and maximum retention (168 backups)
- **Audit Trail Integration**: All backup operations logged via AuditTrailService
- **File Path Handling**: Supports both relative and absolute backup directory paths
- **Database Restoration**: Complete restore functionality with connection management
- **Error Recovery**: Failed backups tracked with detailed error messages

### User Experience Features
- **Interactive UI**: JavaScript-powered confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- **Visual Status**: Color-coded success/failure indicators with progress metrics
- **File Size Display**: Human-readable file sizes with compression ratio indicators
- **Navigation Integration**: Backup management accessible from main Configuration dropdown
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface following existing Bootstrap patterns

### Technical Quality
- **Service Registration**: Proper dependency injection with scoped BackupService
- **Database Patterns**: Following established EF Core patterns with proper error handling
- **Async Operations**: All backup operations fully asynchronous with proper cancellation
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic disposal of file streams and background service resources
- **Logging Integration**: Comprehensive logging at all operational levels

**Status: Ready for Testing** - All Phase A2 deliverables completed. Backup system provides enterprise-level data protection with automated scheduling, compression, and comprehensive management interface.

### SQLite Backup Fix (Post-Testing)
- **Issue**: SQLite file locking error when creating backups while database is active
- **Root Cause**: File copying doesn't work with active SQLite connections and WAL files
- **Solution**: Implemented SQLite `VACUUM INTO` command for safe backup creation
- **Final Improvements**: 
  - Uses SQLite `VACUUM INTO` command which works with active connections and WAL files
  - Leverages existing EF Core connection instead of creating new file connections
  - Temporary file handling with retry logic for proper cleanup
  - Maintains compatibility with both compressed and uncompressed backups
  - Updated restore functionality to use proper SQLite connection management
