# ShopBoss v2 Development Worklog (Condensed)

## Project Overview
ShopBoss v2 is a modern shop floor tracking system replacing the discontinued Production Coach software. Built with ASP.NET Core 8.0, Entity Framework Core 9.0.0, SQLite database, SignalR real-time updates, and Bootstrap 5 UI for millwork manufacturing workflow management.

**Architecture:** MVC pattern with hierarchical data import from Microvellum SDF files, supporting workflow: CNC cutting → Sorting → Assembly → Shipping.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Models - COMPLETED (2025-06-18)

**Objective:** Establish core application structure and data architecture.

### Key Achievements:
- **Repository Structure:** Complete ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC application with SQLite database
- **Core Data Models:** WorkOrder, Product, Part, Subassembly, Hardware, DetachedProduct with proper Entity Framework relationships
- **Database Architecture:** Microvellum ID preservation, 2-level subassembly nesting, cascade delete patterns
- **Bootstrap 5 UI:** Admin interface with work order management, import workflow foundation
- **Git Integration:** Clean repository with proper .gitignore and remote configuration

### Technical Specifications Met:
- All dimensions stored in millimeters as specified
- Microvellum IDs preserved exactly as imported (string primary keys)
- Maximum 2 levels of subassembly nesting enforced
- Database migrations and build verification successful

### Phase 1 Import Constraint Fixes - COMPLETED (2025-07-04)

**Problem:** Import failures due to duplicate constraint violations in Hardware and NestSheet entities.

**Hardware ID Constraint Fix:**
- **Issue:** `UNIQUE constraint failed: Hardware.Id` when SDF files contained duplicate hardware items across products
- **Solution:** Refactored Hardware model with auto-generated GUID primary keys and preserved MicrovellumId field
- **Implementation:** Added hardware grouping logic in ImportSelectionService to sum quantities for identical items
- **Database:** Created HardwareIdRefactor migration to update schema

**NestSheet Barcode Constraint Fix:**
- **Issue:** `UNIQUE constraint failed: NestSheets.Barcode` during import testing
- **Root Cause:** Global unique constraint too restrictive for Microvellum's standard numbering system
- **Understanding:** Barcodes are unique per work order but repeat across different work orders (standard SDF structure)
- **Solution:** Changed database constraint from global unique to composite unique (WorkOrderId, Barcode)
- **Database:** Created FixNestSheetBarcodeConstraint migration to update constraint

**Results:** Both fixes verified with successful import of previously problematic SDF files. Hardware count discrepancy (82 raw → 4 grouped) is expected behavior during deduplication process.

---

## Phase 2: Product Quantity Handling - COMPLETED (2025-07-04)

**Objective:** Implement proper handling of products with Qty > 1 throughout the entire system workflow.

### **Problem Identified**
When products had Qty > 1, the system incorrectly treated them as single instances, causing:
- Hardware quantities not multiplied correctly (observed 82 raw → 18 final discrepancy)
- Assembly/shipping stations unable to track multiple product instances
- Business logic gap in manufacturing workflow validation

### **Architectural Solution: Product Instance Normalization**
**Breakthrough Decision:** Instead of modifying complex assembly/shipping logic, normalize products during import.

**Implementation:** Products with Qty > 1 converted to multiple individual products with Qty = 1:
- Product with Qty = 3 becomes 3 separate products: "Cabinet (Instance 1)", "Cabinet (Instance 2)", "Cabinet (Instance 3)"
- Each instance gets unique ID: `{originalId}_1`, `{originalId}_2`, etc.
- Hardware quantities naturally multiply correctly (each product processes its own hardware)

### **Key Technical Changes**
**ImportSelectionService Updates:**
- Modified `ProcessSelectedProducts` to create multiple product instances in for-loop
- Removed unused `ProcessSelectedHardware` method (all hardware is product-associated)
- Added validation logging for product quantity conversions
- Each product instance processes parts, subassemblies, and hardware independently

**Assembly/Shipping Logic Compatibility:**
- **No changes required** - existing logic works perfectly with normalized products
- Each product instance tracked individually through assembly completion
- Shipping validation works per-product without modification
- UI automatically shows individual product instances

### **Business Value Achieved**
- **Correct Hardware Quantities:** SDF with Product Qty=3 requiring 2 hinges now correctly creates 6 total hinges
- **Individual Tracking:** Assembly station must complete each product instance separately
- **Shipping Accuracy:** Each product instance must be individually scanned and shipped
- **Simplified Logic:** No complex "instance tracking" needed throughout system

### **Phase 2E: Entity ID Uniqueness Fix (2025-07-04)**
**Critical Issue Discovered:** Product normalization caused Entity Framework tracking conflicts
- Parts, subassemblies with identical IDs across product instances
- Error: "The instance of entity type 'Part' cannot be tracked because another instance with the same key value for {'Id'} is already being tracked"

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced `ConvertToPartEntity` and `ConvertToSubassemblyEntity` methods
- Added `productInstanceId` parameter to track unique product instances
- Logic: If product instance ID contains "_" suffix (e.g., "PROD_1"), append suffix to part/subassembly IDs
- Example: Part "PART001" in "PRODUCT_2" becomes "PART001_2"
- Maintains Microvellum ID traceability while ensuring Entity Framework uniqueness

**Technical Implementation:**
- `ProcessSelectedPartsForProduct` passes product instance ID to entity creation methods
- `ProcessSelectedItemsInSubassembly` recursively maintains instance ID context
- Parent-child subassembly relationships preserve instance suffix consistency
- Null reference warnings addressed with null-forgiving operators

### **Phase 2F: Single Quantity Product Logic Fix (2025-07-04)**
**Critical Issue Discovered:** ID uniqueness logic was incorrectly applied to single quantity products
- Single quantity products (Qty = 1) don't need unique IDs but were getting processed as if they did
- Root cause: `productInstanceIdForUniqueness` was being passed as `product.Id` for all products

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified logic to only pass `productInstanceIdForUniqueness` when `productQuantity > 1`
- For single quantity products: `productInstanceIdForUniqueness = null`
- For multi-quantity products: `productInstanceIdForUniqueness = product.Id` (which contains "_N" suffix)
- Updated method signatures: `ProcessSelectedPartsForProduct` and `ProcessSelectedSubassembliesForProduct`

**Business Logic:**
- Single products: Parts/subassemblies keep original Microvellum IDs
- Multi-instance products: Parts/subassemblies get unique IDs with instance suffix

## Phase 3: WorkOrderService Architecture & NestSheet Data Issues - COMPLETED (2025-07-05)

**Objective:** Fix critical NestSheet data display issues and create proper service architecture.

### **Problem Statement**
Two critical issues affecting core functionality:
1. **NestSheet Data Missing**: CNC station showed 0 parts per nest sheet, ModifyWorkOrder showed 0 nest sheets
2. **Service Architecture**: `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` was semantically misplaced in ShippingService

### **Technical Implementation**
**WorkOrderService Creation:**
- Created `Services/WorkOrderService.cs` with centralized work order data management
- Moved and renamed `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` → `GetWorkOrderManagementDataAsync` 
- Added proper NestSheet includes: `.Include(w => w.NestSheets).ThenInclude(n => n.Parts)`
- Created additional optimized methods: `GetWorkOrderWithNestSheetsAsync`, `GetWorkOrderSummariesAsync`

**Data Model Updates:**
- Enhanced `WorkOrderManagementData` with `NestSheets` and `NestSheetSummary` properties
- Added `NestSheetSummary` class for statistical display
- Maintained `ProductStatusNode` structure for hierarchical data

**Controller Updates:**
- Updated AdminController to inject and use WorkOrderService
- Modified ModifyWorkOrder action to use new service method
- Updated Program.cs with service registration: `builder.Services.AddScoped<WorkOrderService>()`

**View Enhancements:**
- Enhanced ModifyWorkOrder.cshtml with NestSheet statistics display
- Added fourth stats card showing: Total NestSheets, Processed count, Pending count, Total Parts count
- Updated model declaration from StatusManagementData to WorkOrderManagementData

**ShippingService Cleanup:**
- Removed `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` method and related classes
- Removed `StatusManagementData`, `ProductStatusNode`, `CalculateEffectiveStatus` 
- Maintained only shipping-specific functionality

### **Success Criteria Met**
- ✅ CNC station displays correct part counts for each nest sheet
- ✅ ModifyWorkOrder view shows accurate nest sheet count (e.g., "4 Nest Sheets" with breakdown)
- ✅ All controllers use WorkOrderService for consistent data loading
- ✅ Improved service architecture with semantic clarity
- ✅ Application builds successfully and user confirmed functionality

## Phase 4: Unified Interface Architecture & Performance Crisis Resolution - COMPLETED (2025-07-05)

**Objective:** Fix critical memory leak causing timeouts and create unified tree interface architecture.

### **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE CRISIS RESOLVED**

**Phase 3 Side Effect:** WorkOrderService implementation caused severe performance degradation:
- ❌ **Memory Leak**: Large work orders (100+ products) caused indefinite loading with fan spin-up
- ❌ **Root Cause**: EF Core cartesian product explosion from multiple Include statements 
- ❌ **Query Impact**: Potential 2.5 trillion row combinations from complex ThenInclude chains
- ❌ **Rendering Issue**: Server-side Razor loops generating 250,000+ HTML elements

### **Phase 4A: Emergency Performance Fix**
**Split Query Architecture Implementation:**
- Completely rewrote `GetWorkOrderManagementDataAsync` using separate, optimized queries
- Eliminated cartesian product by loading entities independently:
  ```csharp
  var workOrder = await _context.WorkOrders.FirstOrDefaultAsync(w => w.Id == workOrderId);
  var products = await _context.Products.Where(p => p.WorkOrderId == workOrderId).ToListAsync();
  var parts = await _context.Parts.Where(p => p.Product.WorkOrderId == workOrderId).Include(p => p.Product).ToListAsync();
  ```
- Added `BuildProductNodes` method for in-memory object graph construction
- Reduced database load from trillions of rows to manageable separate queries

### **Phase 4B: Unified JavaScript Tree Component**

- API features:
  - Paginated product loading (default 100 items per page)
  - On-demand product detail loading
  - Lightweight work order summaries
  - Proper error handling and response formatting

### **Phase 4D: Unified Interface Implementation**
**ModifyWorkOrderUnified.cshtml Creation:**

### **Integration and Controller Updates**
**AdminController Enhancement:**
- Modified ModifyWorkOrder action to use lightweight work order verification
- Switched to new unified view: `View("ModifyWorkOrderUnified", id)`
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API endpoints

### **Performance Results Achieved**
- ✅ **Query Optimization**: Eliminated cartesian product explosion
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Fixed memory leak causing fan spin-up
- ✅ **Load Time**: Large work orders now load in <5 seconds instead of timing out

- **Technical**: Unified codebase reduces maintenance overhead and development complexity
- Single quantity products: Parts/subassemblies keep original Microvellum IDs (no Entity Framework conflicts)
- Multi quantity products: Parts/subassemblies get unique IDs with instance suffix (prevents conflicts)

### **Phase 2G: DetachedProduct Entity Framework Conflict Fix (2025-07-04)**
**Critical Issue Discovered:** `ProcessSinglePartProductsAsDetached` method causing tracking conflicts
- Single-part products were being converted to DetachedProducts while original Parts remained tracked
- Product instances (with "_" in ID) were incorrectly being processed as single-part products
- Error occurred after successful product instance creation: "Identified 18 single-part products as detached products"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Multi-quantity products split into instances (e.g., `253EO4QCCXWF_1`, `253EO4QCCXWF_2`)
- Some instances might have only 1 part each
- `ProcessSinglePartProductsAsDetached` tried to convert these to DetachedProducts
- Original Part entities still tracked by Entity Framework → conflict

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `ProcessSinglePartProductsAsDetached` to skip product instances (`!p.Id.Contains("_")`)
- Added proper cleanup: Remove original Product entities after creating DetachedProducts
- Prevents double-tracking of Part entities
- Updated logging to reflect exclusion of product instances

**Technical Fix:**
- Filter: `workOrder.Products.Where(p => p.Parts.Count == 1 && !p.Id.Contains("_"))`
- Cleanup: `workOrder.Products.Remove(product)` after DetachedProduct creation
- Maintains business logic for genuine single-part products while protecting product instances

### **Phase 2H: Global Part ID Tracking & EF Sensitive Logging (2025-07-04)**
**Persistent Issue Identified:** Entity Framework conflicts continued despite previous fixes
- Error persisted even after DetachedProduct fix
- Analysis revealed potential cross-product part sharing in SDF import data
- Multiple products with same names but different IDs suggested shared components

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- SDF files may contain shared parts across different products
- When creating product instances, same parts were being created multiple times
- Global part ID tracking was missing, causing Entity Framework to track duplicate entities
- Example: Part "PART001" referenced by multiple products → multiple instances created identical parts

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Global Part ID Tracking**: Added `HashSet<string> processedPartIds` parameter throughout processing chain
- **Duplicate Detection**: Check `processedPartIds.Contains(part.Id)` before adding parts
- **Skip Duplicates**: Log warning and skip part creation if already processed
- **EF Sensitive Logging**: Enabled `EnableSensitiveDataLogging()` for development debugging

**Technical Implementation:**
- Updated method signatures: `ProcessSelectedProducts`, `ProcessSelectedPartsForProduct`, `ProcessSelectedSubassembliesForProduct`, `ProcessSelectedItemsInSubassembly`
- Added global tracking parameter cascade through entire processing hierarchy
- Implemented duplicate skip logic with detailed warning logging
- Maintains part uniqueness across all product instances and subassemblies

**Business Logic Preserved:**
- First occurrence of part gets processed and added to appropriate product/subassembly
- Subsequent references to same part are skipped with warning log
- Hardware quantities still multiply correctly per product instance
- Assembly/shipping workflow remains unaffected

### **Phase 2I: Part ID Uniqueness Logic Bug Fix (2025-07-04)**
**Critical Bug Discovered:** Part ID uniqueness logic was fundamentally broken
- Logic compared `productInstanceId != productId` but both were the same value (`product.Id`)
- This meant `needsUniqueIds` was always false, so part IDs were never made unique
- Global part tracking was masking the real issue by incorrectly skipping parts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `ProcessSelectedProducts` passed `product.Id` as `productInstanceIdForUniqueness`
- `ConvertToPartEntity` received `product.Id` as both `productId` and `productInstanceId` parameters
- Comparison `productInstanceId != productId` was always false
- Parts for product instances never got unique suffixes (e.g., `Part001_1`, `Part001_2`)
- Result: Multiple product instances tried to create parts with identical IDs → Entity Framework conflict

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Fixed uniqueness logic**: Simplified to check `productInstanceId.Contains("_")` only
- **Removed broken comparison**: No longer compare `productInstanceId != productId`
- **Removed global tracking**: Eliminated `processedPartIds` parameter and skip logic
- **Restored proper behavior**: Each product instance now gets complete set of uniquely-ID'd parts

**Before Fix:**
- Product `253EO4QCCXWF_1` creates `Part001`
- Product `253EO4QCCXWF_2` tries to create `Part001` → Entity Framework conflict

**After Fix:**
- Product `253EO4QCCXWF_1` creates `Part001_1`
- Product `253EO4QCCXWF_2` creates `Part001_2` → No conflicts

**Result:** No parts skipped, each product instance has complete set of parts, hardware quantities multiply correctly

### **Phase 2J: DetachedProduct Filtering Fix (2025-07-04)**
**Issue Discovered:** Detached product filtering was broken after product normalization
- Single-part product filtering was detecting 0 products instead of converting them to detached products
- Root cause: Product normalization creates IDs with "_" suffix (e.g., `PROD_1`, `PROD_2`)
- Previous filter excluded all products with "_" in ID: `!p.Id.Contains("_")`
- This prevented normalized single-part products from becoming detached products

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed the `!p.Id.Contains("_")` exclusion condition from `ProcessSinglePartProductsAsDetached`
- Restored original filtering logic: products with exactly 1 part become detached products
- Updated logging to reflect that we no longer exclude product instances

**Business Logic Restored:**
- Original products with Qty = 1 and exactly 1 part → become detached products
- Normalized product instances that have exactly 1 part → also become detached products
- Maintains extensible design for future enhancements while supporting product normalization

### **Success Validation**
- Build successful with comprehensive logging
- Assembly completion logic validates each product instance individually
- Shipping logic requires each product instance to be fully assembled before shipping
- Hardware multiplication resolves the 82→18 quantity discrepancy issue
- Detached product filtering works correctly for normalized products
- **Entity Framework tracking conflicts resolved - import process now works correctly**

## Bug Fix Session - Shipping Station Issues (2025-07-03)

**Problem:** Shipping Station had multiple JavaScript issues:
1. "Ship Item" button click had no effect 
2. Progress circle showed permanent "Loading..." state
3. No items appeared in "Recent Scans" section

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Missing jQuery dependency** - JavaScript used `$` but jQuery wasn't loaded
2. **Incorrect SignalR path** - Used `signalr.min.js` instead of `signalr.js`
3. **Premature progress initialization** - Called before DOM was ready

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added jQuery script reference before SignalR
2. Corrected SignalR script path
3. Added setTimeout delay for progress initialization
4. Enhanced JavaScript debugging with console.log statements
5. **Added ScanPart method** - New endpoint for scanning individual parts (most common case)
6. **Updated scan logic** - Now tries parts first, then products, hardware, detached products
7. **Fixed promise chain** - Replaced `.finally()` with `.always()` for better jQuery compatibility
8. **Fixed progress API** - Added null-safe property access for response data

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ShopBoss.Web/Views/Shipping/Index.cshtml` - Fixed JavaScript dependencies, scanning logic, and progress handling
- `src/ShopBoss.Web/Controllers/ShippingController.cs` - Added ScanPart method for individual part scanning

**Additional Issues Fixed:**
9. **Corrected business logic** - Scanning any part from a product now marks the entire product as shipped (all parts)
10. **Fixed Recent Scans disappearing** - Removed automatic page reload that was clearing the Recent Scans list
11. **Updated success messages** - Now shows product shipping success instead of individual part messages

**Ship Button Feature Added:**
12. **Manual Ship buttons** - Added "Ship" buttons to each line item in Products, Hardware, and Detached Products lists
13. **Confirmation dialogs** - Each Ship button shows a confirmation dialog before shipping
14. **Status updates** - Manual shipping updates the UI and refreshes the page to show new status

**Final Fixes:**
15. **Progress circle fixed** - Handled camelCase JSON serialization for progress data (products.total vs Products.Total)
16. **Ship button JavaScript scope** - Made shipping functions global using window object to fix onclick handler errors
17. **Recent Scans persistence** - Removed ALL page reload calls (handleScanSuccess function was still reloading)
18. **Dynamic UI updates** - Added JavaScript functions to update item styling (green background, "Shipped" status) without page reload

**Testing Required:**
- Progress circle should show actual shipping progress instead of "Loading..."
- Scanning any part from a product should mark the entire product as shipped (all parts)
- Recent Scans should persist and not disappear after successful scans
- Success message should indicate product shipping, not individual part shipping
- Ship buttons should appear next to ready items and work without scanning
- Ship buttons should show confirmation dialogs and update the page after shipping

## Phase 1: Hardware Import Duplicate Fix - COMPLETED (2025-07-04)

**Objective:** Fix critical hardware import bug where duplicate Microvellum IDs caused database constraint violations during work order import.

### Problem Analysis
**Root Cause:** Hardware model used Microvellum ID directly as primary key, causing `UNIQUE constraint failed: Hardware.Id` when SDF files contained:
- Multiple identical hardware items across different products
- Single hardware entries with quantities > 1 that should be summed

### Solution Architecture
**Database Schema Refactor:** Changed Hardware model from Microvellum ID primary key to auto-generated GUID system:
- **Hardware.Id**: Now auto-generated GUID string for unique database identity
- **Hardware.MicrovellumId**: New field preserves original Microvellum ID for reference
- **Quantity Summation**: Hardware items grouped by MicrovellumId+Name with quantities summed

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Hardware Model Refactor
**Database Schema Changes:**
```csharp
// Before: Hardware.Id = importHardware.Id (Microvellum ID)
// After: Hardware.Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
//        Hardware.MicrovellumId = importHardware.Id
```

#### 2. Import Logic Enhancement
**ProcessSelectedHardware() Method:**
- **Grouping Logic**: Group hardware by `{ Id, Name }` to identify duplicates
- **Quantity Aggregation**: Sum quantities for identical hardware items across products
- **Deduplication**: Prevent processing same Microvellum ID multiple times
- **Audit Preservation**: Maintain processed hardware tracking for consistency

**ProcessSelectedHardwareForProduct() Method:**
- **Consistent Logic**: Applied same grouping and summation logic for product-level hardware
- **Work Order Integration**: Hardware entities added to work order collection with proper references
- **Status Tracking**: Maintained conversion statistics and result tracking

#### 3. Database Migration
**Migration: HardwareIdRefactor**
- **Schema Update**: Added MicrovellumId column to Hardware table
- **Primary Key Change**: Modified Hardware.Id to support GUID values
- **Data Preservation**: Existing hardware data handled through migration process
- **Applied Successfully**: Database updated without data loss

### Technical Benefits

#### 1. Resolved Critical Issues

## Phase 3: WorkOrderService Architecture & NestSheet Data Issues - COMPLETED (2025-07-05)

**Objective:** Fix critical data display issues and improve service architecture by creating centralized WorkOrderService.

### Problems Addressed:
**Critical Data Display Issues:**
- ❌ CNC station displayed nest sheets but showed 0 associated parts for each
- ❌ Modify Work Order view showed 0 Nest Sheets in the stats bar
- ❌ NestSheet-to-Part relationships not properly loaded in data queries

**Service Architecture Problems:**
- ❌ `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` method semantically misplaced in `ShippingService`
- ❌ Method provided general work order management data, not shipping-specific functionality
- ❌ Active work order management scattered across multiple controllers with inconsistent queries
- ❌ No centralized work order data service for consistent database Include patterns

### Implementation Completed:

#### 3A: WorkOrderService Creation ✅
- **New Service:** Created comprehensive `Services/WorkOrderService.cs` with centralized work order data management
- **Core Method:** `GetWorkOrderManagementDataAsync()` with proper NestSheets Include statements
- **Additional Methods:** `GetWorkOrderWithNestSheetsAsync()`, `GetWorkOrderSummariesAsync()`, `GetWorkOrderByIdAsync()`
- **Business Logic:** Moved `CalculateEffectiveStatus()` method for product status calculations

#### 3B: Data Model Enhancement ✅
- **New Model:** `WorkOrderManagementData` replaces `StatusManagementData`
- **NestSheet Integration:** Added `List<NestSheet> NestSheets` property with full part relationships
- **Summary Statistics:** Created `NestSheetSummary` class with processed/pending counts and total part statistics
- **Navigation Properties:** All models properly include NestSheets with ThenInclude(n => n.Parts)

#### 3C: Controller Updates ✅

    .Include(w => w.Hardware)
    .Include(w => w.DetachedProducts)
    .Include(w => w.NestSheets).ThenInclude(n => n.Parts)  // FIXED: NestSheets now included
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(w => w.Id == workOrderId);
```

#### NestSheet Statistics Calculation
```csharp
var nestSheetSummary = new NestSheetSummary
{
    TotalNestSheets = workOrder.NestSheets.Count,
    ProcessedNestSheets = workOrder.NestSheets.Count(n => n.IsProcessed),
    PendingNestSheets = workOrder.NestSheets.Count(n => !n.IsProcessed),
    TotalPartsOnNestSheets = workOrder.NestSheets.Sum(n => n.Parts.Count)
};
```
