# Sorting Rules Management Interface Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive web interface for managing the existing extensible sorting rules system that determines how parts are automatically routed to appropriate rack types during the sorting process.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **Database Model**: `SortingRule` entity with:
  - Name, Priority (lower = higher precedence)
  - Keywords (comma-separated string)
  - TargetRackType (Standard, DoorsAndDrawerFronts, AdjustableShelves, Hardware, Cart)
  - IsActive flag, CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate
- **Service Layer**: `SortingRuleService.DetermineRackTypeForPartAsync()` processes rules by priority order
- **Seeded Defaults**: Three pre-configured rules for specialized rack types
- **Integration**: Used throughout sorting workflow for automatic part routing

### Current Workflow
1. Part enters sorting system
2. `DetermineRackTypeForPartAsync()` queries active rules ordered by priority
3. First matching rule determines target rack type
4. Parts route to appropriate specialized or standard racks
5. No match defaults to Standard rack type

## Controller Architecture Decision

### Option 1: AdminController (Current Plan)
**Pros:**
- Follows existing pattern (RackConfiguration is in AdminController)
- Administrative function fits Admin menu structure
- Centralized admin functionality

**Cons:**
- AdminController is already large with many responsibilities
- Less semantic separation of concerns

### Option 2: SortingController
**Pros:**
- Semantically related to sorting functionality
- Rules directly impact sorting operations
- More focused controller responsibility

**Cons:**
- SortingController currently focuses on operational/runtime tasks
- Would mix operational and administrative concerns
- Administrative UI doesn't belong in sorting station workflow

### Option 3: New SortingRulesController
**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Dedicated controller for rule management
- Follows REST principles for resource management
- Room for growth (analytics, reporting, etc.)
- Cleaner URL structure (/SortingRules/ vs /Admin/SortingRules)

**Cons:**
- Additional controller to maintain
- Menu organization needs consideration

### Recommended Approach: New SortingRulesController

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Controller & Models
**Files to Create:**
- `Controllers/SortingRulesController.cs`
- `Models/SortingRuleTestRequest.cs` (for keyword testing)

**Controller Actions:**
```csharp
// GET /SortingRules
public async Task<IActionResult> Index(string search = "", RackType? filterType = null, bool? activeOnly = null)

// GET /SortingRules/Create
public IActionResult Create()

// POST /SortingRules/Create
public async Task<IActionResult> Create(SortingRule model)

// GET /SortingRules/Edit/{id}
public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(int id)

// POST /SortingRules/Edit/{id}
public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(int id, SortingRule model)

// POST /SortingRules/Delete/{id}
public async Task<IActionResult> Delete(int id)

// POST /SortingRules/ToggleStatus/{id}
public async Task<IActionResult> ToggleStatus(int id)

// POST /SortingRules/UpdatePriorities
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdatePriorities(int[] ruleIds)

// POST /SortingRules/TestKeywords
public async Task<IActionResult> TestKeywords(string keywords, string testPartName)
```

### Phase 2: Views & User Interface
**Files to Create:**
- `Views/SortingRules/Index.cshtml` → `@model List<SortingRule>`
- `Views/SortingRules/Create.cshtml` → `@model SortingRule`
- `Views/SortingRules/Edit.cshtml` → `@model SortingRule`
- `Views/SortingRules/_RuleEditor.cshtml` → Shared partial for Create/Edit forms

**UI Features:**
- Master list with search/filter capabilities
- Inline priority reordering (drag-and-drop)
- Real-time keyword testing
- Bulk enable/disable operations
- Visual priority indicators
- Rule impact preview

### Phase 3: Navigation & Integration
**Files to Modify:**
- `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` - Add "Sorting Rules" to Admin dropdown menu

**Menu Structure:**
```
Admin ↓
├── Work Orders
├── Rack Configuration  
├── Sorting Rules ← NEW
├── Backup Management
└── Health Dashboard
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
**Advanced Functionality:**
- Drag-and-drop priority management with visual feedback
- Real-time part name testing with immediate feedback
- Rule conflict detection and warnings
- Bulk operations with confirmation dialogs
- Rule usage analytics (which rules match most frequently)

### Phase 5: Client-Side Enhancements
**Files to Create:**
- `wwwroot/js/sorting-rules.js` - Interactive functionality

**JavaScript Features:**
- Sortable priority list
- Real-time keyword testing
- AJAX form submissions
- Confirmation dialogs
- Visual feedback for actions

## Database Considerations
- No schema changes required - existing `SortingRule` entity is sufficient
- Leverage existing EF Core context and relationships
- Maintain compatibility with current seeding logic

## Testing Strategy
- Built-in keyword testing tool in the interface
- Validation of rule priorities and conflicts
- Integration testing with existing sorting workflow
- Performance testing with large rule sets

## Security Considerations
- Admin-only access (leverage existing authentication)
- CSRF protection on all POST operations
- Input validation for keywords and rule parameters
- Audit trail for rule changes (leverage existing AuditTrailService)

## Future Enhancements
- Rule templates and presets
- Import/export rule configurations
- Rule usage analytics and reporting
- Advanced pattern matching (regex support)
- Conditional rules based on work order or product attributes
