# Friday Assembly Announcement Fix

## Problem Identified
System does constant assembly readiness checks after every part sort, causing duplicate announcements and inefficiency.

Current flow:
1. Sort cabinet parts → Cabinet becomes ready → Billboard: "Cabinet ready for assembly" ✅
2. Sort Detached Product part → System runs assembly check → Finds cabinet is still ready → Billboard: "Cabinet ready for assembly" again ❌

## Root Cause
In `SortingController.cs` (lines 415-424), after ANY part is sorted, the system:
- Always checks for assembly-ready products (even for Detached Product parts)
- Only looks at the `Products` table (ignores `DetachedProducts`)
- Finds the same cabinet that was already ready
- Re-announces it via SignalR "ProductReadyForAssembly" event

## Elegant Solution: Event-Driven Announcements

Instead of **reactive checking** (constantly checking after every sort), use **event-driven announcements** (announce only when the last part of a product gets sorted).

### Implementation Plan

1. **Find the bin modal completion logic** that determines when a product's last part gets sorted
2. **Move the assembly announcement** from the constant checking loop to this precise moment  
3. **Remove the constant assembly checks** from the main sorting flow
4. **Announce only once** when the product actually transitions to complete

### Benefits
- **Perfect timing**: Announce exactly when product becomes ready
- **No duplicates**: Each product announced only once
- **More efficient**: No constant checking overhead
- **Cleaner logic**: Event-driven vs polling-based
- **Leverages existing code**: Reuse proven completion detection

### Target Areas
- Find bin modal logic that tracks product completion
- Remove assembly checks from `SortingController.cs` main sorting flow (lines 415-424)
- Add assembly announcement to the completion event

### Current Implementation to Modify
```csharp
// In SortingController.cs around lines 415-424
// Remove this constant checking:
var assemblyReadyProducts = await _sortingRuleService.CheckAssemblyReadinessAsync(activeWorkOrderId);
if (assemblyReadyProducts.Any())
{
    foreach (var productId in assemblyReadyProducts)
    {
        var readyProduct = await _context.Products.FindAsync(productId);
        if (readyProduct != null)
        {
            await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ProductReadyForAssembly", new
            {
                productId = readyProduct.Id,
                productName = readyProduct.Name,
                productNumber = readyProduct.ProductNumber,
                workOrderId = activeWorkOrderId,
                timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"),
                sortingStation = station
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### Result
Clean, efficient, one-time announcements exactly when products become ready for assembly, eliminating duplicate billboard messages.
