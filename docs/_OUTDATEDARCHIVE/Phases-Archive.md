Maintain product grouping within the specialized rack so parts from the same product are stored together. Update the Bin Details modal to show Progress (parts scanned vs total carcass parts needed) instead of arbitrary capacity, ensuring the denominator reflects only carcass parts required for assembly readiness (excluding filtered parts).

**Implementation Approach:**
Create an extensible filtering system that can be easily expanded with additional keywords or rules in the future. For initial implementation, filter based on Part Name containing keywords: "door", "drawer front", or "adjustable shelf" (case-insensitive). Design the filtering logic as a configurable service that can accommodate future rule additions without code changes.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Extensible part classification service with keyword-based filtering
- Part type detection logic examining Part.Name for target keywords
- Automatic routing to appropriate rack types based on part classification

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Extensible `PartFilteringService` with configurable keyword rules
- [ ] Part type classification system (Doors/Drawer Fronts/Adjustable Shelves vs Carcass Parts)
- [ ] Initial keyword filtering: "door", "drawer front", "adjustable shelf" (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Automatic rack routing logic based on part type classification
- [ ] Product grouping within Doors & Fronts rack (same product parts → same bin)
- [ ] Updated Bin Details modal showing Progress instead of Capacity
- [ ] Assembly readiness calculation that accounts for filtered parts
- [ ] Progress denominator reflecting only carcass parts needed for assembly
- [ ] Enhanced sorting algorithm that handles multiple rack types intelligently

**Integration Points:**
- Integrate with existing `SortingRuleService` for rack assignment logic
- Update `CheckProductAssemblyReadiness()` method to exclude filtered parts
- Modify bin details modal in Sorting/Index.cshtml
- Ensure SignalR updates reflect accurate progress across rack types

**Future Extensibility:**
- Design filtering service to accommodate additional keywords, regex patterns, or complex rules
- Prepare architecture for potential database-driven filtering configuration

This phase completes the sorting station's intelligent routing capabilities, ensuring parts flow to the appropriate processing streams while maintaining accurate assembly readiness tracking.

### Phase 9C: Manual Status Management Interface (2 hours)
**Prompt for Claude Code:**
> Create a comprehensive manual status management view that displays all data for the active work order in a hierarchical table format (inspired by the import tree view) with the ability to manually adjust part, product, hardware, and detached product statuses. This administrative interface should provide fine-grained control over the manufacturing workflow when barcode scanning is not available or corrections are needed. **IMPORTANT**: Extend existing services rather than creating new ones to maintain architectural consistency and reduce code duplication.

**Revised Architecture Approach:**
- **Extend ShippingService**: Add general-purpose status management methods that work across all stations
- **Leverage AuditTrailService**: Use existing audit logging patterns with "Manual" station designation
- **Reuse SignalR patterns**: Follow established StatusHub notification patterns from other controllers
- **Extend AdminController**: Add new action methods following existing patterns (similar to Modify/WorkOrder actions)

**Key Features:**
- **Hierarchical Data Display**: Products as top-level nodes with Parts/Hardware/Subassemblies nested underneath (reuse import tree view patterns)
- **Unrestricted Status Changes**: Allow any status transition including backward moves for testing purposes
- **Cascading Product Updates**: When changing product status, automatically update all associated parts
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select functionality for bulk status changes with transaction rollback
- **Search/Filter Integration**: Real-time filtering by item name, status, or type for large work orders
- **Admin-Only Access**: New tab in Admin station interface with appropriate access controls

**Technical Implementation Strategy:**

**1. Service Layer Extensions:**
```csharp
// Extend ShippingService.cs (rename to WorkOrderStatusService.cs)
public async Task<bool> UpdatePartStatusAsync(string partId, PartStatus newStatus, string changedBy = "Manual")
public async Task<bool> UpdateProductStatusAsync(string productId, PartStatus newStatus, bool cascadeToparts = true)
public async Task<BulkUpdateResult> UpdateMultipleStatusesAsync(List<StatusUpdateRequest> updates)
public async Task<StatusManagementData> GetStatusManagementDataAsync(string workOrderId)
```

**2. Controller Extensions:**
```csharp
// Add to AdminController.cs
public async Task<IActionResult> StatusManagement() // Main view
[HttpPost] public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateStatus(string itemId, string itemType, PartStatus newStatus)
[HttpPost] public async Task<IActionResult> BulkUpdateStatus(List<StatusUpdateRequest> updates)
```

**3. View Implementation:**
- **File**: `Views/Admin/StatusManagement.cshtml`
- **Pattern**: Reuse tree view CSS/JS from `Import.cshtml` but adapt for status management
- **Structure**: Hierarchical table with Products → Parts/Subassemblies/Hardware
- **Interaction**: Inline status dropdowns, bulk select checkboxes, search/filter controls

**4. Data Models:**
```csharp
public class StatusManagementData
{
    public WorkOrder WorkOrder { get; set; }
    public List<ProductStatusNode> ProductNodes { get; set; }
    public List<PartStatus> AvailableStatuses { get; set; }
}

public class ProductStatusNode
{
    public Product Product { get; set; }
    public List<Part> Parts { get; set; }
    public List<Subassembly> Subassemblies { get; set; }
    public List<Hardware> Hardware { get; set; }
    public PartStatus EffectiveStatus { get; set; } // Calculated from parts
}

public class StatusUpdateRequest
{
    public string ItemId { get; set; }
    public string ItemType { get; set; } // "Part", "Product", "Hardware", "DetachedProduct"
    public PartStatus NewStatus { get; set; }
    public bool CascadeToChildren { get; set; } = false;
}
```

**5. Integration Points:**
- **AuditTrailService**: Log manual changes with station="Manual" and details="Manual status change via Admin interface"
- **StatusHub SignalR**: Broadcast status changes using existing patterns from other controllers
- **Navigation**: Add "Status Management" tab to Admin/Index.cshtml alongside existing Import/Modify buttons
- **Permissions**: Ensure admin-only access using existing session-based patterns

**Design Patterns to Reuse:**
1. **Tree View Structure**: Copy hierarchical display patterns from `Import.cshtml` (lines 13-104 for CSS, 659-918 for JS tree building)
2. **Status Management**: Follow patterns from `ShippingController.cs` status update methods
3. **Bulk Operations**: Adapt bulk delete patterns from `AdminController.cs` BulkDeleteWorkOrders method
4. **SignalR Integration**: Copy notification patterns from `AssemblyController.cs` or `ShippingController.cs`
5. **Admin Navigation**: Follow existing tab patterns in `Admin/Index.cshtml`

**Business Rules:**
- **Unrestricted Transitions**: Allow any status change (Shipped → Pending, etc.) for testing flexibility
- **Product-Level Cascading**: When product status changes, automatically update all associated parts to same status
- **Audit Trail**: All manual changes logged with clear "Manual" designation vs barcode scans
- **Active Work Order Only**: Display data only for currently selected active work order
- **Confirmation Required**: Modal dialogs for potentially disruptive changes

**File Modification Plan:**
1. **Extend**: `Services/ShippingService.cs` → Add status management methods
2. **Extend**: `Controllers/AdminController.cs` → Add StatusManagement, UpdateStatus, BulkUpdateStatus actions
3. **Create**: `Views/Admin/StatusManagement.cshtml` → Main interface (reuse Import.cshtml patterns)
4. **Modify**: `Views/Admin/Index.cshtml` → Add "Status Management" navigation tab
5. **Register**: `Program.cs` → No changes needed (ShippingService already registered)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Hierarchical table displaying Products → Parts/Hardware/Subassemblies structure
- [ ] Individual status dropdowns with immediate update capability
- [ ] Product-level status changes cascade to all associated parts automatically
- [ ] Bulk selection and status change with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Search/filter functionality for large work orders (1000+ items)
- [ ] All manual changes properly logged in audit trail as "Manual" station
- [ ] Real-time SignalR notifications to other stations when statuses change
- [ ] Admin-only access with proper session validation
- [ ] Unrestricted status transitions including backward moves (Shipped → Pending)
- [ ] Responsive design working on both tablet and desktop
- [ ] Potential replacement candidate for import tree view if user approves outcome

**Testing Requirements:**
1. **Single Updates**: Verify individual part/product status changes work correctly
2. **Cascading Logic**: Test product status changes properly update all associated parts
3. **Bulk Operations**: Test multi-select operations with proper transaction rollback on errors
4. **Cross-Station Sync**: Verify other stations receive real-time status updates via SignalR
5. **Audit Trail**: Confirm all changes logged with "Manual" designation vs "CNC"/"Sorting" etc.
6. **Large Dataset Performance**: Test with 500+ parts to ensure responsive interface
7. **Permission Validation**: Verify admin-only access and active work order requirements

This implementation leverages existing architectural patterns while providing powerful manual status management capabilities, maintaining system consistency and reducing maintenance overhead.

# ShopBoss v2 Development Phases Continued

## Analysis and Plan for Import Workflow Integration

## **Phase 1: Hardware Duplication Fix (Critical Bug) - COMPLETED**
**Immediate Need - Blocking Current Functionality**

1. **Root Cause**: Hardware model uses Microvellum ID as primary key, but SDF can have:
   - Single hardware line with Qty > 1 
   - Multiple identical hardware lines from different products that should sum

2. **Solution Strategy**: 
   - Change Hardware.Id to auto-generated GUID
   - Add Hardware.MicrovellumId field for original ID
   - Group hardware by Name+WorkOrderId during import
   - Sum quantities for identical hardware items

3. **Database Migration Required**: Yes - change primary key structure

## **Phase 2: Product Quantity Handling (Critical Business Logic)**
**Fundamental Requirement - Multiple Product Instance Support**

### **Problem Statement**
Currently when a Product has Qty > 1, the system treats it as a single instance but doesn't properly multiply:
- Hardware quantities (causing discrepancies like 82 raw → 18 final)
- Part manufacturing requirements across multiple product instances
- Assembly completion validation for all product instances
- Shipping completion logic to verify all instances are complete

### **Technical Analysis**
**ImportSelectionService Issues:**
- Lines 317-334, 402-417: Hardware grouping sums quantities but ignores `product.Qty` multiplier
- Missing calculation: `totalQuantity * product.Qty` for hardware items
- Part quantities may need instance multiplication logic

**Assembly/Shipping Logic Gaps:**
- AssemblyController: Progress calculations ignore multiple product instances
- ShippingController: Completion validation doesn't verify all product instances manufactured
- UI displays don't show "X parts × Y products = Z total" breakdown

### **Implementation Tasks**

**2A: Import Quantity Multiplication**
1. Update ImportSelectionService hardware processing to multiply by product.Qty
2. Add part quantity logic for multiple product instances if needed
3. Implement validation for quantity logic consistency
4. Test with multi-quantity SDF files to verify correct multiplication

**2B: Assembly Station Updates**
1. Modify assembly progress calculations to account for product quantities
2. Update completion validation to verify all product instances are assembled
3. Enhance UI to show "X parts × Y products = Z total" breakdown
4. Update bin capacity logic to handle multiple product instances

**2C: Shipping Station Updates**
1. Update shipping completion validation for multiple product instances
2. Modify progress tracking to handle product quantity requirements
3. Update completion reports to show per-instance tracking status
4. Ensure work order completion logic validates all instances shipped

**2D: UI and Display Updates**
1. Update quantity displays throughout system to show instance breakdown
2. Add product instance tracking to status displays
3. Modify progress bars to show product-quantity-adjusted completion percentage
4. Update audit logs to track product instance-level operations

### **Implementation Plan**
1. Update ImportSelectionService to multiply hardware by product.Qty
2. Modify assembly progress calculations for multiple product instances
3. Update shipping completion validation for all product instances
4. Enhance UI displays to show per-instance vs total quantities
5. Test with multi-quantity SDF files
6. Verify end-to-end workflow with multiple product instances

### **Success Criteria**
- SDF with Product Qty=3 creates 3× the expected hardware quantities
- Assembly station requires completion of all product instances before marking product complete
- Shipping station validates all instances are manufactured before allowing work order completion
- UI clearly differentiates between per-instance quantities and total requirements

## **Phase 3: WorkOrderService Architecture & NestSheet Data Issues (Critical Infrastructure)**
**Immediate Need - Fixing Data Display and Service Architecture**

### **Problem Statement**
Two critical issues have been identified that affect core functionality:

1. **NestSheet Data Missing in Views**:
   - CNC station displays nest sheets but shows 0 associated parts for each
   - Modify Work Order view shows 0 Nest Sheets in the stats bar
   - NestSheet-to-Part relationships not properly loaded in data queries

2. **Service Architecture Issues**:
   - `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` method is semantically misplaced in `ShippingService`
   - This method provides comprehensive work order data for admin/management purposes, not shipping-specific functionality
   - Active work order management is scattered across multiple controllers
   - No centralized work order data service for consistent queries

### **Technical Analysis**
**Current Issues:**
- `ShippingService.GetStatusManagementDataAsync` (lines 158-198) doesn't include NestSheets in the query
- Method includes Products, Parts, Subassemblies, Hardware, DetachedProducts but missing NestSheets
- Service naming suggests shipping-specific functionality but actually provides general work order management data
- Multiple controllers duplicate work order querying logic with different Include patterns

**CNC Controller Analysis:**
- Lines 41-45: Properly loads NestSheets with `.Include(n => n.Parts)` for CNC station
- Admin ModifyWorkOrder uses ShippingService which lacks NestSheet data
- Data inconsistency between different views of the same work order

### **Implementation Tasks**

**3A: Create WorkOrderService**
1. Create new `Services/WorkOrderService.cs` with comprehensive work order data management
2. Move `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` from ShippingService to WorkOrderService
3. Rename method to `GetWorkOrderManagementDataAsync` for clarity
4. Add NestSheets to the query with proper Include statements
5. Create additional methods for common work order queries used across controllers

**3B: Update StatusManagementData Model**
1. Add `List<NestSheet> NestSheets { get; set; }` to StatusManagementData class
2. Update the WorkOrderService to populate NestSheets with Parts included
3. Ensure NestSheet data includes part counts and processing status

**3C: Update Controllers**
1. Update AdminController to use WorkOrderService instead of ShippingService
2. Update other controllers to use WorkOrderService for consistent work order queries
3. Remove duplicated work order querying logic
4. Ensure all controllers use the same Include patterns for consistent data loading

**3D: Update Views**
1. Update ModifyWorkOrder.cshtml to display NestSheet information in stats bar
2. Add NestSheet count and processing status to the work order summary
3. Ensure CNC station and Admin station show consistent NestSheet data
4. Add NestSheet details to the work order management interface

**3E: ShippingService Cleanup**
1. Remove `GetStatusManagementDataAsync` from ShippingService
2. Update ShippingService to use WorkOrderService for work order data needs
3. Keep only shipping-specific logic in ShippingService
4. Update ShippingController to use WorkOrderService for work order queries

### **Detailed Implementation Plan**

**Step 1: Create WorkOrderService**
```csharp
// Services/WorkOrderService.cs
public class WorkOrderService
{
    public async Task<WorkOrderManagementData> GetWorkOrderManagementDataAsync(string workOrderId)
    {
        // Include all entities: Products, Parts, Subassemblies, Hardware, DetachedProducts, NestSheets
        // Return comprehensive work order data for admin/management purposes
    }
    
    public async Task<WorkOrder> GetWorkOrderWithNestSheetsAsync(string workOrderId)
    {
        // Optimized query for NestSheet-focused operations
    }
    
    public async Task<List<WorkOrder>> GetWorkOrderSummariesAsync(string searchTerm = "")
    {
        // Optimized query for work order listing
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Update Data Models**
```csharp
// Update StatusManagementData to WorkOrderManagementData
public class WorkOrderManagementData
{
    public WorkOrder WorkOrder { get; set; } = null!;
    public List<ProductStatusNode> ProductNodes { get; set; } = new();
    public List<PartStatus> AvailableStatuses { get; set; } = new();
    public List<NestSheet> NestSheets { get; set; } = new(); // ADD THIS
    public NestSheetSummary NestSheetSummary { get; set; } = new(); // ADD THIS
}

public class NestSheetSummary
{
    public int TotalNestSheets { get; set; }
    public int ProcessedNestSheets { get; set; }
    public int PendingNestSheets { get; set; }
    public int TotalPartsOnNestSheets { get; set; }
}
```

**Step 3: Update Controllers**
- AdminController: Replace ShippingService with WorkOrderService
- CncController: Use WorkOrderService for consistency
- Other controllers: Standardize work order queries

**Step 4: Update Views**
- ModifyWorkOrder.cshtml: Add NestSheet stats display
- Ensure consistent NestSheet data across all views

### **Files to Modify**
1. `Services/WorkOrderService.cs` (NEW)
2. `Services/ShippingService.cs` (REMOVE GetStatusManagementDataAsync)
3. `Controllers/AdminController.cs` (UPDATE ModifyWorkOrder action)
4. `Controllers/CncController.cs` (UPDATE to use WorkOrderService)
5. `Controllers/ShippingController.cs` (UPDATE to use WorkOrderService)
6. `Views/Admin/ModifyWorkOrder.cshtml` (ADD NestSheet stats)
7. `Program.cs` (REGISTER WorkOrderService)

### **Success Criteria**
- CNC station displays correct part counts for each nest sheet
- Modify Work Order view shows accurate nest sheet count in stats bar
- All controllers use WorkOrderService for consistent work order data loading
- NestSheet data is consistently available across all work order views
- ShippingService contains only shipping-specific logic
- WorkOrderService provides centralized work order data management

### **Testing Requirements**
1. Load work order in CNC station - verify nest sheets show correct part counts
2. Open Modify Work Order view - verify nest sheet count appears in stats bar
3. Process a nest sheet in CNC - verify part counts update correctly
4. Verify shipping functionality still works after service refactor
5. Test active work order functionality across all stations

### **Risk Assessment: MEDIUM**
- Service architecture changes affect multiple controllers
- Data model changes require careful migration
- Views depend on specific data structure
- Must maintain backward compatibility during transition

### **Business Value: HIGH**
- Fixes critical data display issues affecting daily operations
- Improves service architecture for better maintainability
- Provides foundation for future work order management features
- Ensures consistent data across all work order views

## **Phase 4: Unified Interface Architecture & Performance Crisis Resolution (Critical)**
**Immediate Priority - Fix Memory Leak & Create Unified Interface**

### **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

**Phase 3 Implementation Caused Performance Crisis:**
- ❌ **Memory Leak**: WorkOrderService query creates massive cartesian product (billions of rows)
- ❌ **Timeout**: Large work orders (100+ products) cause indefinite loading with fan spin-up
- ❌ **Root Cause**: Multiple EF Core Include statements creating exponential data explosion
- ❌ **Compound Issue**: Server-side Razor rendering of thousands of HTML elements

**Interface Architecture Problems:**
- ❌ **Inconsistent UX**: Import uses efficient JavaScript tree, Modify uses server-side rendering
- ❌ **Performance Gap**: Import loads quickly, Modify times out
- ❌ **Maintenance Overhead**: Two completely different tree implementations
- ❌ **User Confusion**: Different layouts and interaction patterns

### **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

#### **Database Query Explosion**
```csharp
// PROBLEMATIC QUERY - Creates cartesian product
var workOrder = await _context.WorkOrders
    .Include(w => w.Products).ThenInclude(p => p.Parts)           // 100 × 10 = 1,000
    .Include(w => w.Products).ThenInclude(p => p.Subassemblies)   // 100 × 50 = 5,000
        .ThenInclude(s => s.Parts)                                // 50 × 5 = 250
    .Include(w => w.Hardware)                                     // 200 items
    .Include(w => w.DetachedProducts)                             // 10 items
    .Include(w => w.NestSheets).ThenInclude(n => n.Parts)        // 20 × 50 = 1,000
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(w => w.Id == workOrderId);
// Result: 1,000 × 5,000 × 250 × 200 × 10 × 1,000 = 2.5 TRILLION rows!
```

#### **Server-Side Rendering Explosion**
```razor
@foreach (var productNode in Model.ProductNodes)  // 100 products
{
    @foreach (var part in productNode.Parts)      // 10 parts each = 1,000 iterations
    {
        @foreach (var subassembly in productNode.Subassemblies)  // 50 subs = 5,000 iterations
        {
            @foreach (var part in subassembly.Parts)  // 5 parts = 25,000 iterations
            // Total: 100 × 10 × 50 × 5 = 250,000 HTML generations!
```

#### **Interface Performance Comparison**
| Feature | Import Interface (Fast) | Modify Interface (Broken) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Loading** | AJAX paginated calls | Single massive EF query |
| **Rendering** | JavaScript client-side | Server-side Razor loops |
| **Tree Building** | Lazy/incremental | All-at-once generation |
| **Memory Usage** | Minimal, on-demand | Exponential explosion |
| **User Experience** | Responsive, smooth | Timeout, fans spinning |

### **UNIFIED SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE**

#### **4A: Emergency Performance Fix**
**Immediate database query optimization using split queries:**

```csharp
public async Task<WorkOrderManagementData> GetWorkOrderManagementDataAsync(string workOrderId)
{
    // Split into separate queries to avoid cartesian product
    var workOrder = await _context.WorkOrders.FindAsync(workOrderId);
    
    var products = await _context.Products
        .Where(p => p.WorkOrderId == workOrderId)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    var parts = await _context.Parts
        .Where(p => p.Product.WorkOrderId == workOrderId)
        .Include(p => p.Product)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    var subassemblies = await _context.Subassemblies
        .Where(s => s.Product.WorkOrderId == workOrderId)
        .Include(s => s.Parts)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    var nestSheets = await _context.NestSheets
        .Where(n => n.WorkOrderId == workOrderId)
        .Include(n => n.Parts)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    var hardware = await _context.Hardware
        .Where(h => h.WorkOrderId == workOrderId)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    // Build relationships in memory (small dataset)
    return BuildWorkOrderData(workOrder, products, parts, subassemblies, nestSheets, hardware);
}
```

#### **4B: Unified JavaScript Tree Component**
**Create single reusable tree component based on Import interface success:**

```typescript
class WorkOrderTreeView {
    constructor(containerId, mode = 'view') {
        this.mode = mode; // 'import', 'modify', 'view'
        this.container = document.getElementById(containerId);
        this.enableModification = (mode === 'modify' || mode === 'import');
        this.enableSelection = (mode === 'import');
    }
    
    async loadData(workOrderId, pagination = {page: 0, size: 100}) {
        // Paginated AJAX loading
        const response = await fetch(`/api/workorder/${workOrderId}/tree?page=${pagination.page}&size=${pagination.size}`);
        return response.json();
    }
    
    renderNode(nodeData, level = 0) {
        // Unified rendering logic for all modes
        // Import mode: checkboxes + selection logic
        // Modify mode: status dropdowns + bulk actions
        // View mode: read-only display
    }
}
```

#### **4C: API Controller for Paginated Data**
**Create efficient API endpoints for tree data loading:**

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/workorder")]
public class WorkOrderApiController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{workOrderId}/tree")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetTreeData(string workOrderId, int page = 0, int size = 100)
    {
        // Return paginated tree data as JSON
        // Products with counts only, load details on-demand
    }
    
    [HttpGet("{workOrderId}/products/{productId}/details")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetProductDetails(string workOrderId, string productId)
    {
        // Load product parts/subassemblies only when expanded
    }
}
```

### **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

#### **Phase 4A: Emergency Performance Fix (High Priority)**
1. **Fix WorkOrderService Query**: Implement split queries to eliminate cartesian product
2. **Add EF Core Split Query Configuration**: `.AsSplitQuery()` where appropriate
3. **Implement Pagination Support**: Add Skip/Take to large data queries

- **Unified Experience**: Single interface reduces user confusion and training
- **Scalability**: Supports growth to larger manufacturing operations
- **Performance**: Fast, responsive interface improves daily workflow efficiency
- **Maintainability**: Single tree component reduces code duplication and bugs

## **Phase 5: Hardware Quantity Multiplication Fix & Two-Phase Processing Architecture (Critical Bug)**
**Status: IDENTIFIED - Implementation Required**
**Priority: Critical - Blocking Unified Interface Development**

### **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Critical Bug Discovered**: Hardware items are not being properly multiplied when Products have multiple quantities. This was an unintended side effect of the successful Product quantity normalization implemented in previous phases.

**Root Cause**: The current ImportSelectionService uses a single-pass approach that tries to normalize products AND process their contents simultaneously. This leads to:
- Hardware being processed once per product type instead of once per product instance
- Complex tracking with `processedHardwareIds` and `productInstanceIdForUniqueness` parameters
- Mixed concerns making the code difficult to maintain and debug

### **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

#### **Current Problem in ImportSelectionService.cs**
```csharp
// Lines 228-268: Product normalization creates multiple product instances
for (int i = 1; i <= productQuantity; i++)
{
    var product = ConvertToProductEntity(importProduct, workOrder.Id);
    if (productQuantity > 1)
    {
        product.Id = $"{importProduct.Id}_{i}";
        product.Name = $"{importProduct.Name} (Instance {i})";
    }
    
    // Lines 264: Hardware processing called once per product instance
    ProcessSelectedHardwareForProduct(importProduct, selection, product, workOrder, processedHardwareIds, result);
}

// Lines 317-363: Hardware processing uses global tracking
private void ProcessSelectedHardwareForProduct(...)
{
    // PROBLEM: processedHardwareIds prevents hardware duplication across product instances
    if (processedHardwareIds.Contains(hardwareGroup.Key.Id))
    {
        continue; // ❌ SKIPS hardware for subsequent product instances
    }
    
    processedHardwareIds.Add(hardwareGroup.Key.Id); // ❌ BLOCKS future product instances
}
```

#### **Example of Current Bug**
```
SDF Input:
- Product "Cabinet A" (Qty: 3)
  - Hardware "Hinge" (Qty: 2 per product)
  - Hardware "Handle" (Qty: 1 per product)

Expected Output:
- Product "Cabinet A (Instance 1)" + Product "Cabinet A (Instance 2)" + Product "Cabinet A (Instance 3)"
- Hardware "Hinge" (Total Qty: 6) - 2 × 3 products
- Hardware "Handle" (Total Qty: 3) - 1 × 3 products

Current Buggy Output:
- Product "Cabinet A (Instance 1)" + Product "Cabinet A (Instance 2)" + Product "Cabinet A (Instance 3)" ✅
- Hardware "Hinge" (Total Qty: 2) - Only processed for first instance ❌
- Hardware "Handle" (Total Qty: 1) - Only processed for first instance ❌
```

### **SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE: TWO-PHASE PROCESSING**

#### **Phase 1: Product Normalization (Clean Separation)**
```csharp
private List<Product> NormalizeProductQuantities(
    ImportWorkOrder importData, 
    SelectionRequest selection, 
    WorkOrder workOrder)
{
    var normalizedProducts = new List<Product>();
    
    foreach (var importProduct in selectedImportProducts)
    {
        var productQuantity = importProduct.Quantity;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= productQuantity; i++)
        {
            var product = ConvertToProductEntity(importProduct, workOrder.Id);
            
            if (productQuantity > 1)
            {
                product.Id = $"{importProduct.Id}_{i}";
                product.Name = $"{importProduct.Name} (Instance {i})";
            }
            product.Qty = 1; // Each instance is quantity 1
            
            normalizedProducts.Add(product);
        }
    }
    
    return normalizedProducts;
}
```

#### **Phase 2: Content Processing (Per Individual Product)**
```csharp
private void ProcessProductContent(
    ImportProduct importProduct,
    SelectionRequest selection,
    Product normalizedProduct,
    WorkOrder workOrder,
    ImportConversionResult result)
{
    // Process parts for this individual product
    ProcessSelectedPartsForProduct(importProduct, selection, normalizedProduct, workOrder, result);
    
    // Process subassemblies for this individual product
    ProcessSelectedSubassembliesForProduct(importProduct, selection, normalizedProduct, workOrder, result);
    
    // Process hardware for this individual product (NO GLOBAL TRACKING)
    ProcessSelectedHardwareForProduct(importProduct, selection, normalizedProduct, workOrder, result);
}
```

#### **Hardware Processing Simplification**
```csharp
private void ProcessSelectedHardwareForProduct(
    ImportProduct importProduct,
    SelectionRequest selection,
    Product product,
    WorkOrder workOrder,
    ImportConversionResult result)
{
    // NO MORE processedHardwareIds tracking - each product instance gets its own hardware
    var selectedHardwareIds = GetSelectedHardwareIds(selection);
    
    foreach (var importHardware in importProduct.Hardware.Where(h => selectedHardwareIds.Contains(h.Id)))
    {
        var hardware = new Hardware
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            MicrovellumId = importHardware.Id,
            Name = importHardware.Name,
            Qty = importHardware.Quantity, // Original quantity per product
            WorkOrderId = product.WorkOrderId
        };
        
        workOrder.Hardware.Add(hardware);
        result.Statistics.ConvertedHardware++;
    }
}
```

### **INTERFACE CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **Import Preview Interface**
- **Current**: Shows original products with their quantities
- **After Fix**: Must show normalized products (individual instances) in preview
- **UI Enhancement**: "Product A (Qty: 3)" → "Product A (Instance 1)", "Product A (Instance 2)", "Product A (Instance 3)"
- **Hardware Display**: Show multiplied hardware quantities in preview

#### **Modify Work Order Interface**
- **Current**: Already works with normalized products
- **After Fix**: Hardware quantities will be correctly displayed
- **Consistency**: Both interfaces will show identical data structure

#### **Unified Interface Benefits**
- **Data Consistency**: Both interfaces process data identically
- **Predictable Behavior**: Users see the same normalization in both contexts
- **Simplified Logic**: Single processing path for both import and modification

### **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

#### **5A: Core Refactoring (High Priority)**
1. **Extract Product Normalization**: Create separate `NormalizeProductQuantities` method
2. **Simplify Hardware Processing**: Remove global tracking, process per individual product
3. **Update Main Processing Loop**: Use two-phase approach
4. **Preserve Part Quantity Logic**: Ensure part quantities within products are handled correctly
5. **Test Hardware Multiplication**: Verify hardware quantities are correctly multiplied

#### **5B: Interface Updates (Medium Priority)**
1. **Update Import Preview**: Show normalized products in preview tree
2. **Verify Modify Work Order**: Ensure hardware quantities display correctly
3. **UI Consistency**: Ensure both interfaces show identical data structure
4. **Update Statistics**: Hardware counts should reflect multiplied quantities

#### **5C: Testing & Validation (High Priority)**
1. **Multi-Quantity Product Tests**: Test products with various quantities (1, 2, 5, 10)
2. **Hardware Multiplication Tests**: Verify hardware quantities are correctly multiplied
3. **Part Quantity Tests**: Ensure parts with individual quantities are handled correctly
4. **Interface Consistency Tests**: Verify both interfaces show identical data
5. **End-to-End Workflow Tests**: Test complete import → assembly → shipping workflow

### **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION**

#### **Modified ProcessSelectedProducts Method**
```csharp
private void ProcessSelectedProducts(
    ImportWorkOrder importData, 
    SelectionRequest selection, 
    WorkOrder workOrder, 
    ImportConversionResult result)
{
    // Phase 1: Normalize products into individual instances
    var normalizedProducts = NormalizeProductQuantities(importData, selection, workOrder);
    
    // Phase 2: Process content for each individual product
    foreach (var product in normalizedProducts)
    {
        workOrder.Products.Add(product);
        
        // Find the original import product for this normalized product
        var originalProductId = product.Id.Contains("_") ? 
            product.Id.Substring(0, product.Id.LastIndexOf('_')) : 
            product.Id;
        
        var importProduct = importData.Products.First(p => p.Id == originalProductId);
        
        // Process content for this individual product (no global tracking)
        ProcessProductContent(importProduct, selection, product, workOrder, result);
        
        result.Statistics.ConvertedProducts++;
    }
}
```

#### **Simplified Hardware Processing**
```csharp
private void ProcessSelectedHardwareForProduct(
    ImportProduct importProduct,
    SelectionRequest selection,
    Product product,
    WorkOrder workOrder,
    ImportConversionResult result)
{
    var selectedHardwareIds = selection.SelectedItemIds
        .Where(id => selection.SelectionDetails.ContainsKey(id) && 
                    selection.SelectionDetails[id].ItemType == "hardware")
        .ToHashSet();

    foreach (var importHardware in importProduct.Hardware.Where(h => selectedHardwareIds.Contains(h.Id)))
    {
        var hardware = new Hardware
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            MicrovellumId = importHardware.Id,
            Name = importHardware.Name,
            Qty = importHardware.Quantity, // Original quantity per product
            WorkOrderId = product.WorkOrderId
        };
        
        workOrder.Hardware.Add(hardware);
        result.Statistics.ConvertedHardware++;
    }
}
```

### **RISK ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM**
- **Data Integrity**: Changes to core import logic require careful testing
- **Interface Consistency**: Both interfaces must show identical data
- **Performance**: Two-phase processing may impact import performance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing work orders must continue to work

### **BUSINESS VALUE: HIGH**
- **Accurate Manufacturing Data**: Correct hardware quantities for production planning
- **Unified Interface Foundation**: Clean architecture supports interface consolidation
- **Improved User Experience**: Consistent data across all interfaces
- **Maintainable Code**: Separated concerns make future enhancements easier

### **DEPENDENCIES**
- **Prerequisite**: Phase 4 (Unified Interface Architecture) benefits from this fix
- **Blocker**: Must be completed before final interface consolidation
- **Foundation**: Provides clean architecture for future enhancements

## **Phase 6: Unified Interface Foundation & Modify Work Order Rebuild (Critical Architecture)**
**Status: PLANNED - Ready for Implementation**
**Priority: High - Consolidating Interface Architecture**

### **STRATEGIC VISION**

**Core Principle**: The Import Preview interface represents the target unified design. The Modify Work Order interface must be rebuilt to use the same foundation, data sources, and visual structure.

**Key Insight**: Import Preview is semantically just a specialized view of the unified interface. Both interfaces must:
- Use identical data loading patterns
- Share the same tree rendering logic  
- Display the same statistics and structure
- Differ only in their interaction capabilities (selection vs status management)

### **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

#### **Import Preview Interface (Target Design - ✅ Good Foundation)**
**Strengths to Preserve:**
- ✅ **Clean Visual Layout**: Bordered content areas with logical organization
- ✅ **Statistics Bar**: Icon-based counts for Products, Parts, Subassemblies, Hardware, Nest Sheets
- ✅ **Tree Structure**: Hierarchical data display with expand/collapse functionality
- ✅ **Action Controls**: Select All, Clear All, Expand/Collapse, Export capabilities
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works well on tablets and desktop

**Issues to Fix:**
- ❌ **Hardware Statistics**: Shows incorrect counts (7 selected vs actual multiplied quantities)
- ❌ **Nest Sheets Missing from Tree**: Should appear as top-level category alongside Products, Hardware, Detached Products

#### **Modify Work Order Interface (Needs Complete Rebuild - ❌ Wrong Foundation)**
**Current Problems:**
- ❌ **Different Data Loading**: Uses WorkOrderService with complex EF queries vs Import's efficient JSON approach
- ❌ **Server-Side Rendering**: Razor loops create massive HTML vs Import's client-side JavaScript tree
- ❌ **Performance Issues**: Timeouts and memory leaks vs Import's smooth performance
- ❌ **Inconsistent UI**: Different styling, layout, and interaction patterns
- ❌ **Missing Features**: No statistics bar, export capabilities, or bulk operations

**Current Capabilities to Preserve:**
- ✅ **Status Management**: Line-by-line status dropdown modifications
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: SignalR integration for cross-station updates
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Tracks all status changes with timestamps

### **UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**

#### **Shared Foundation Components**

**1. Unified Data API**
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/workorder")]
public class WorkOrderTreeApiController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{workOrderId}/tree")]
    public async Task<WorkOrderTreeData> GetTreeData(string workOrderId, bool includeStatus = false)
    {
        // Single API endpoint serves both Import Preview and Modify Work Order
        // includeStatus flag determines if status information is included
    }
    
    [HttpPost("{workOrderId}/status")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateStatus(string workOrderId, StatusUpdateRequest request)
    {
        // Status updates for Modify interface (not used in Import)
    }
}
```

**2. Unified Tree Component**
```typescript
class UnifiedWorkOrderTree {
    constructor(containerId, mode) {
        this.mode = mode; // 'import-preview' | 'modify-workorder'
        this.enableSelection = (mode === 'import-preview');
        this.enableStatusManagement = (mode === 'modify-workorder');
    }
    
    async loadData(workOrderId) {
        const includeStatus = this.enableStatusManagement;
        const response = await fetch(`/api/workorder/${workOrderId}/tree?includeStatus=${includeStatus}`);
        return response.json();
    }
    
    renderNode(nodeData, level = 0) {
        // Unified rendering with mode-specific features:
        // Import Preview: checkboxes, selection tracking
        // Modify Work Order: status dropdowns, bulk actions
    }
}
```

#### **Tree Structure Design (Mode-Specific Layouts)**

**CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION**: The two interfaces will have different hardware organization patterns to optimize for their specific use cases, with future toggle capability.

#### **Import Preview Mode - Hardware Nested Under Products**
**Philosophy**: During import selection, users need to see hardware grouped with their parent products to understand relationships and make informed selections.

**Top-Level Categories:**
1. **📋 Products** - Hierarchical structure including nested hardware items
2. **📦 Detached Products** - Standalone items not part of main hierarchy  
3. **📄 Nest Sheets** - Manufacturing sheets with associated parts

**Example Structure:**
```
🏭 Kitchen Remodel Project (Work Order) - Import Preview Mode
├── 📋 Products (42 total, 42 selected)
│   ├── 📦 Cabinet A (Instance 1)
│   │   ├── 🔧 Side Panel (Qty: 2) 
│   │   ├── 🔧 Door (Qty: 1)
│   │   ├── 📁 Subassembly X
│   │   │   └── 🔧 Shelf (Qty: 3)
│   │   └── 🛠️ Hardware for this Product
│   │       ├── 🔩 Hinge (Qty: 2) ← Per-product quantity
│   │       └── 🔗 Handle (Qty: 1) ← Per-product quantity
│   ├── 📦 Cabinet A (Instance 2)
│   │   ├── 🔧 Side Panel (Qty: 2)
│   │   ├── 🔧 Door (Qty: 1)
│   │   └── 🛠️ Hardware for this Product
│   │       ├── 🔩 Hinge (Qty: 2) ← Per-product quantity
│   │       └── 🔗 Handle (Qty: 1) ← Per-product quantity
├── 📦 Detached Products (12 total, 12 selected)
│   └── 🪵 Crown Molding (Qty: 1)
└── 📄 Nest Sheets (50 total, 50 selected)
    ├── 📑 Sheet_001.dwg (15 parts) [Status: Processed]
    └── 📑 Sheet_002.dwg (8 parts) [Status: Pending]

Statistics Bar: Hardware (6 total) ← Shows multiplied totals: Hinges(4) + Handles(2)
```

#### **Modify Work Order Mode - Hardware as Separate Category**
**Philosophy**: During work order management, hardware is managed independently from products for inventory, ordering, and assembly planning purposes.

**Top-Level Categories:**
1. **📋 Products** - Hierarchical product/part/subassembly structure (no hardware)
2. **🛠️ Hardware** - All hardware items as separate category (correctly multiplied quantities)
3. **📦 Detached Products** - Standalone items not part of main hierarchy  
4. **📄 Nest Sheets** - Manufacturing sheets with associated parts

**Example Structure:**
```
🏭 Kitchen Remodel Project (Work Order) - Modify Work Order Mode
├── 📋 Products (42 total, 42 selected)
│   ├── 📦 Cabinet A (Instance 1)
│   │   ├── 🔧 Side Panel (Qty: 2) [Status: Cut] 
│   │   ├── 🔧 Door (Qty: 1) [Status: Pending]
│   │   └── 📁 Subassembly X
│   │       └── 🔧 Shelf (Qty: 3) [Status: Sorted]
│   └── 📦 Cabinet A (Instance 2)
│       ├── 🔧 Side Panel (Qty: 2) [Status: Pending]
│       └── 🔧 Door (Qty: 1) [Status: Pending]
├── 🛠️ Hardware (6 total) ← Separate category for management
│   ├── 🔩 Hinge (Qty: 4) [Status: N/A] ← Multiplied total: 2×2 instances
│   └── 🔗 Handle (Qty: 2) [Status: N/A] ← Multiplied total: 1×2 instances
├── 📦 Detached Products (12 total, 12 selected)
│   └── 🪵 Crown Molding (Qty: 1) [Status: Cut]
└── 📄 Nest Sheets (50 total, 50 selected)

    └── 📑 Sheet_002.dwg (8 parts) [Status: Pending]

Statistics Bar: Hardware (6 total) ← Same multiplied totals, different organization
```

#### **Future Toggle Capability**
```typescript
class UnifiedWorkOrderTree {
    constructor(containerId, mode, options = {}) {
        this.mode = mode;
        this.hardwareDisplayMode = options.hardwareDisplayMode || this.getDefaultHardwareMode();
        // 'nested-in-products' | 'separate-category'
    }
    
    getDefaultHardwareMode() {
        return this.mode === 'import-preview' ? 'nested-in-products' : 'separate-category';
    }
    
    toggleHardwareDisplay() {
        this.hardwareDisplayMode = this.hardwareDisplayMode === 'nested-in-products' 
            ? 'separate-category' 
            : 'nested-in-products';
        this.refresh();
    }
}
```

### **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

#### **6A: Create Unified Data Foundation (High Priority)**

**1. Build WorkOrderTreeApiController**
- Single API endpoint serving both interfaces
- Efficient data loading using Phase 5's normalized product structure
- Proper hardware quantity calculations (fix the "7 selected" issue)
- Include Nest Sheets as top-level category

**2. Create Unified Data Models**
```csharp
public class WorkOrderTreeData
{
    public WorkOrderInfo WorkOrder { get; set; }
    public TreeStatistics Statistics { get; set; }
    public List<TreeCategoryNode> Categories { get; set; } // Products, Hardware, Detached, NestSheets
}

public class TreeCategoryNode
{
    public string Type { get; set; } // "products", "hardware", "detached", "nestsheets"
    public string Name { get; set; } // "Products", "Hardware", etc.
    public string Icon { get; set; } // CSS class for icon
    public int TotalCount { get; set; }
    public int SelectedCount { get; set; } // For import mode
    public List<TreeItemNode> Items { get; set; }
}

public class TreeItemNode
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; } // "product", "part", "subassembly", "hardware", "detached", "nestsheet"
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; } // For modify mode
    public bool IsSelected { get; set; } // For import mode
    public List<TreeItemNode> Children { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object> Metadata { get; set; } // Dimensions, material, etc.
}
```

#### **6B: Create Unified JavaScript Tree Component (High Priority)**

**1. Build UnifiedWorkOrderTree Class**
- Mode-aware rendering (import-preview vs modify-workorder)
- Shared tree visualization logic
- Togglable features based on mode
- Performance optimizations (virtual scrolling for large datasets)

**2. Feature Implementation**
```typescript
// Mode-specific rendering with hardware display logic
renderItemNode(node) {
    const html = `<div class="tree-item" data-id="${node.id}">`;
    
    if (this.enableSelection) {
        // Import Preview mode: checkboxes
        html += `<input type="checkbox" ${node.isSelected ? 'checked' : ''}>`;
    }
    
    if (this.enableStatusManagement) {
        // Modify Work Order mode: status dropdowns
        html += `<select class="status-dropdown" data-id="${node.id}">
                   <option value="Pending" ${node.status === 'Pending' ? 'selected' : ''}>Pending</option>
                   <option value="Cut" ${node.status === 'Cut' ? 'selected' : ''}>Cut</option>
                   <option value="Sorted" ${node.status === 'Sorted' ? 'selected' : ''}>Sorted</option>
                 </select>`;
    }
    
    html += `<span class="item-name">${node.name}</span>`;
    html += `<span class="item-quantity">Qty: ${node.quantity}</span>`;
    return html;
}

// Hardware organization logic
organizeTreeData(rawData) {
    if (this.hardwareDisplayMode === 'nested-in-products') {
        // Import Preview default: Hardware nested under each product
        return this.nestHardwareUnderProducts(rawData);
    } else {
        // Modify Work Order default: Hardware as separate top-level category
        return this.separateHardwareCategory(rawData);
    }
}

nestHardwareUnderProducts(data) {
    // Group hardware items under their respective product instances
    // Statistics still show multiplied totals across all products
}

separateHardwareCategory(data) {
    // Extract all hardware into top-level category with multiplied quantities
    // Products show only parts and subassemblies
}
```

#### **6C: Rebuild Modify Work Order Interface (Medium Priority)**

**1. Replace ModifyWorkOrder.cshtml**
- Remove server-side Razor tree rendering
- Use unified JavaScript tree component in 'modify-workorder' mode
- Preserve existing functionality (status updates, bulk operations)
- Add missing features from Import Preview (statistics bar, export)

**2. Update AdminController**
```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> ModifyWorkOrder(string id)
{
    // Lightweight data loading - tree data comes from API
    var workOrder = await _workOrderService.GetWorkOrderBasicInfoAsync(id);
    
    return View(new ModifyWorkOrderViewModel 
    { 
        WorkOrder = workOrder,
        Mode = "modify-workorder" // Configure tree component mode
    });
}
```

#### **6D: Enhanced Import Preview Interface (Low Priority)**

**1. Fix Hardware Statistics**
- Use corrected hardware quantities from Phase 5 normalization
- Update statistics calculation to reflect multiplied quantities

**2. Add Nest Sheets to Tree**
- Include Nest Sheets as top-level category
- Show associated parts count and processing status
- Enable selection/deselection of nest sheets

**3. Optional Status Preview**
- Add toggle to preview what statuses items will have after import
- Show "Will be imported as: Pending" for better user understanding

# ShopBoss V2 Refactoring Plan: Phase 6 Implementation

**Date:** July 7, 2025  
**Objective:** Rebuild Modify Work Order interface using Import Preview foundation

## Design Reference
**CRITICAL:** The unified interface must visually match the current Import Preview interface. Reference the attached screen.jpg for exact layout, styling, and component placement. The Import Preview design is proven and should be preserved with only minimal adjustments for status management features.

## Unified Interface Modes

### Import Mode (Import Preview - Existing Functionality)
- **Purpose:** Select products/parts for import into new work order
- **Tree Interaction:** Checkboxes for selection (Select All, Clear All)
- **Data State:** Preview data from SDF file (not yet saved to database)
- **Actions:** Import selected items
- **Statistics:** Show counts of selected vs available items
- **Navigation:** Return to import workflow after confirmation
- **REMOVE:** CSV Export button and all related export functionality

### Modify Mode (New Implementation)
- **Purpose:** Manage existing work order items and their statuses
- **Tree Interaction:** Status dropdowns on each item (Pending, Cut, Sorted, etc.)
- **Data State:** Live work order data from database
- **Actions:** Bulk status updates, individual status changes, real-time SignalR updates
- **Statistics:** Show counts by status (Cut, Sorted, Assembled, etc.)
- **Navigation:** Integrate with existing work order management workflow

### Shared Foundation
- **Visual Design:** Identical layout, styling, tree structure, and statistics bar
- **Tree Component:** Same JavaScript component with mode parameter
- **API Backend:** Same data loading with mode-specific fields
- **Performance:** Same optimization for large datasets (1000+ items)

## Core Principles
- Maximum 2-3 files per step
- Side-by-side validation before migration
- Clear rollback plans
- Performance preservation
- Maintain Import Preview visual design

- Import Preview shows accurate DetachedProducts count in statistics card
- DetachedProducts category appears in Import tree view when items exist
- Single-part products are consistently filtered at transform time rather than selection time
- End-to-end Import → Preview → Conversion flow maintains DetachedProducts correctly

**Implementation Details:**
- Replace nested row/column grid in statistics cards with simple stacked divs
- Apply same stacked layout to all 5 statistics cards (Products, Parts, DetachedProducts, Hardware, NestSheets)
- Move `singlePartProducts.Where(p => p.Parts.Count == 1)` logic from ImportSelectionService to ImportDataTransformService
- Create ImportDetachedProduct instances and populate workOrder.DetachedProducts during transformation

## Phase 7: Create Missing Parts for DetachedProducts
**Risk:** LOW - Targeted fix to create missing Part entities for DetachedProducts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
DetachedProducts are created as separate `DetachedProduct` entities during import, but NO corresponding `Part` entities are created. The sorting station only queries the `Parts` table for scannable items, so DetachedProduct "parts" don't exist to be scanned.

**Current Implementation:**
- Regular Products: Create `Product` → Create `Part` entities → Assign to NestSheets → CNC → Sorting
- DetachedProducts: Create `DetachedProduct` only → **NO Parts created** → Can't be processed through CNC/Sorting workflow

**Solution:**
Modify the import process so DetachedProducts ALSO get Part entities created for them, just like regular Products do. This creates the missing Parts infrastructure while preserving all existing DetachedProduct behavior.

**Tasks:**

### 7A: Import System Fix
1. **Update `ProcessSelectedDetachedProducts()` method:**
   - Keep all existing DetachedProduct entity creation unchanged
   - ALSO create a Part entity for each DetachedProduct
   - Part should have same properties as DetachedProduct (name, dimensions, material, etc.)
   - Set Part.ProductId = DetachedProduct.Id (treating DetachedProduct as Product for Part linkage)
   - Assign DetachedProduct Parts to appropriate NestSheet for CNC processing

2. **Create `CreateDetachedProductPart()` helper method:**
   - Convert DetachedProduct properties to Part entity
   - Handle NestSheet assignment
   - Ensure proper audit trail and logging

### 7B: Verification and Testing
1. **Test CNC Workflow:**
   - Verify DetachedProduct Parts appear on NestSheets
   - Confirm CNC processing marks DetachedProduct Parts as Cut

2. **Test Sorting Station:**
   - Should work automatically since Parts will now exist in Parts table
   - Verify DetachedProduct Parts can be scanned and sorted
   - Check if any minor adjustments needed for p.Product navigation

3. **Test Assembly Station:**
   - Ensure Assembly continues to skip DetachedProducts entirely
   - DetachedProduct Parts should not appear in assembly workflows

**Expected Behavior:**
- Sorting station query should automatically find DetachedProduct Parts once they exist
- CNC → Sorting → Shipping workflow will work normally for DetachedProducts
- All existing DetachedProduct functionality preserved exactly as-is

**Preservation Requirements:**
- Tree API continues to show separate "DetachedProducts" category exactly as before
- All statistics and counts remain identical
- Admin interface shows DetachedProducts separately as before  
- Shipping interface continues to handle DetachedProducts as separate entities
- All existing queries and views remain unchanged
- No changes to UI or user experience

**Implementation Order:**
1. Phase 7A: Update import to create Parts for DetachedProducts
2. Phase 7B: Test and verify workflows, make minimal adjustments if needed

**Success Criteria:**
- DetachedProduct Parts can be scanned and sorted at Sorting Station
- All existing functionality and UI remains exactly the same
- Tree API still shows separate DetachedProducts category
- Statistics and counts remain unchanged
- CNC → Sorting → Shipping workflow works for DetachedProducts

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Import SDF file with DetachedProducts - verify DetachedProduct entities AND Parts are created
2. Verify Tree API still shows separate DetachedProducts category (unchanged)
3. Test CNC processing marks DetachedProduct Parts as Cut
4. Test Sorting Station can scan and sort DetachedProduct Parts successfully
5. Verify Assembly Station still skips DetachedProducts completely
6. Test complete CNC → Sorting → Shipping workflow for DetachedProducts
7. Verify all statistics and counts remain identical

**Rollback Plan:**
- Revert import logic to not create Parts for DetachedProducts
- Remove any DetachedProduct Part handling code added

**Post-Completion:**
- Follow Collaboration_Guidelines.md for git commit and documentation
- Update Worklog.md with Phase 7 completion notes
- Verify sorting station issue is completely resolved

- ✅ Consistent scanner behavior across stations without business logic coupling

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED** - Universal Scanner successfully refactored to clean event-based architecture while preserving all functionality and recent bug fixes.

#### **Critical Implementation Notes & Lessons Learned:**

**Universal Scanner Architecture:**
- Universal Scanner is now a **pure input component** that only emits `scanReceived` events
- **No station parameters required** - truly universal across all pages
- Auto-initializes based on `.universal-scanner-input` elements with `data-container` attribute
- Emits events on `document` with `{ barcode, containerId, timestamp, scanner }` detail

**Major Bug Fixes Applied:**
1. **Duplicate Event Emission (Root Cause)**: Universal Scanner was dispatching events twice:
   - Once to container element (which bubbled to document)  
   - Once directly to document
   - **Fix**: Remove container dispatch, only dispatch to document

2. **Content-Type Mismatch**: CNC controller expects form data but was receiving JSON
   - **Fix**: Change from `application/json` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
   - Use `body: \`barcode=${encodeURIComponent(barcode)}\`` instead of `JSON.stringify()`

3. **Duplicate Recent Scans**: Scanner was adding entries in both `processScan()` and `showScanResult()`
   - **Fix**: Remove duplicate entry creation from `showScanResult()` method

4. **Event Listener Cleanup**: Prevents duplicate listeners when navigating between stations
   - **Fix**: Remove existing listeners before adding new ones, add `beforeunload` cleanup

**Station Integration Pattern:**
```javascript
// Each station should follow this pattern:
// 1. Remove existing listeners to prevent duplicates
if (window.stationScanHandler) {
    document.removeEventListener('scanReceived', window.stationScanHandler);
}

// 2. Create named handler function
window.stationScanHandler = function(event) {
    const { barcode, containerId } = event.detail;
    const scanner = window.universalScanners[containerId];
    if (scanner) {
        handleStationScan(barcode, scanner);
    }
};

// 3. Add single event listener
document.addEventListener('scanReceived', window.stationScanHandler);

// 4. Add cleanup on page unload
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function() {
    if (window.stationScanHandler) {
        document.removeEventListener('scanReceived', window.stationScanHandler);
        window.stationScanHandler = null;
    }
});
```

**ViewData Configuration for Universal Scanner:**
```csharp
ViewData["ContainerId"] = "station-scanner";
ViewData["Title"] = "Universal Scanner - Station Name";
ViewData["ShowHelp"] = true;
ViewData["ShowRecentScans"] = true;
ViewData["Placeholder"] = "Scan barcode or enter command...";
// NO ViewData["Station"] needed - scanner is now truly universal
```

**Critical Testing Checklist for Each Station:**
- [ ] Only 1 "Station: Received scan event" message in console
- [ ] Only 1 "Universal Scanner: Emitted scanReceived event" message  
- [ ] Only 1 entry appears in Recent Scans per scan
- [ ] Actual business logic executes (parts marked, items processed, etc.)
- [ ] Correct Content-Type used for server requests
- [ ] Event listeners properly cleaned up between page navigations
