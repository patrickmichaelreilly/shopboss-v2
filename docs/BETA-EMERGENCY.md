## **Beta-Specific Recovery Procedures**

### **Complete System Recovery**

#### **When to Use:**
- Application won't start
- Database corruption
- Major system failure

#### **Recovery Steps:**

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   ```powershell
   # Check system status
   Get-Process -Name "ShopBoss.Web" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   
   # Check service status (if installed as service)
   Get-Service -Name "ShopBoss" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   
   # Check database file
   Test-Path "C:\ShopBoss\shopboss.db"
   ```

2. **Stop All Processes**
   ```powershell
   # Stop ShopBoss processes
   Get-Process -Name "ShopBoss.Web" | Stop-Process -Force
   
   # Clean SQLite locks
   C:\ShopBoss\scripts\clean-sqlite-locks.ps1 -Force
   ```

3. **Restore from External Backup**
   ```powershell
   # List available backups
   C:\ShopBoss\scripts\restore-shopboss-beta.ps1
   
   # Restore from most recent backup
   C:\ShopBoss\scripts\restore-shopboss-beta.ps1 -BackupFilePath "C:\ShopBoss-Backups\[latest-backup]"
   ```

4. **Restart System**
   ```powershell
   # Start ShopBoss service
   Start-Service -Name "ShopBoss"
   
   # Or start manually
   cd C:\ShopBoss
   .\ShopBoss.Web.exe
   ```

5. **Verify Recovery**
   - Test each station (Admin, CNC, Sorting, Assembly, Shipping)
   - Verify active work order data
   - Check recent operations in audit log
   - Test scanner functionality

**Expected Recovery Time: 10-20 minutes**

---

### **Single Station Recovery**

#### **When to Use:**
- One station not responding
- Station-specific errors
- Scanner issues at specific station

#### **Recovery Steps:**

1. **Identify Affected Station**
   - Which station is having issues?
   - Are other stations working normally?
   - Is the issue consistent across users?

2. **Browser-Level Recovery**
   ```powershell
   # Clear browser cache
   # Close and reopen browser
   # Try different browser
   # Check network connectivity
   ```

3. **Application-Level Recovery**
   ```powershell
   # Check application logs
   Get-Content "C:\ShopBoss\logs\*.log" -Tail 50
   
   # Restart application if needed
   Restart-Service -Name "ShopBoss"
   ```

4. **Test Recovery**
   - Navigate to affected station
   - Test basic functionality
   - Test scanner if applicable
   - Verify real-time updates

**Expected Recovery Time: 5-15 minutes**

### **Data Recovery Procedures**

#### **When to Use:**
- Missing work order data
- Parts showing incorrect status
- Lost recent operations

#### **Recovery Steps:**

1. **Assess Data Loss**
   ```powershell
   # Check recent backups
   ls "C:\ShopBoss-Backups" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 10
   
   # Check incremental backups
   ls "C:\ShopBoss-Backups\incremental" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
   ```

2. **Determine Recovery Point**
   - When was the last known good state?
   - What data can be lost without major impact?
   - Are there manual records to cross-reference?

3. **Create Emergency Backup**
   ```powershell
   # Backup current state before recovery
   C:\ShopBoss\scripts\backup-shopboss-beta.ps1 -BackupType "emergency-before-recovery"
   ```

4. **Restore from Backup**
   ```powershell
   # Restore from selected backup
   C:\ShopBoss\scripts\restore-shopboss-beta.ps1 -BackupFilePath "[selected-backup]"
   ```

5. **Verify Data Integrity**
   - Check work order completeness
   - Verify part statuses match physical state
   - Cross-reference with manual records
   - Update any discrepancies

**Expected Recovery Time: 20-45 minutes**

### **Performance Recovery**

#### **When to Use:**
- System running slowly
- High resource usage
- Database performance issues

#### **Recovery Steps:**

1. **Check System Resources**
   ```powershell
   # Check CPU and memory usage
   Get-Process -Name "ShopBoss.Web" | Select-Object CPU, WorkingSet, PagedMemorySize
   
   # Check disk space
   Get-PSDrive C | Select-Object Used, Free
   
   # Check database size
   Get-Item "C:\ShopBoss\shopboss.db" | Select-Object Length, LastWriteTime
   ```

2. **Clear Database Locks**
   ```powershell
   # Clean SQLite locks
   C:\ShopBoss\scripts\clean-sqlite-locks.ps1
   ```

3. **Restart Application**
   ```powershell
   # Restart ShopBoss service
   Restart-Service -Name "ShopBoss"
   ```

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check response times at each station
   - Monitor resource usage for 10 minutes
   - Test scanner responsiveness
   - Check database query performance

**Expected Recovery Time: 5-10 minutes**
