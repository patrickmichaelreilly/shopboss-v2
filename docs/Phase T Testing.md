‚óè Perfect! Phase T: Testing Infrastructure & Data Safety is now COMPLETE!

  üéâ Phase T Completion Summary

  I've successfully implemented all Phase T deliverables:

  ‚úÖ T1: Quick Win Scripts (30 minutes)

  - External Backup Directory: C:\ShopBoss-Backups configured as default
  - SQLite Lock Cleanup: scripts/clean-sqlite-locks.ps1 with process detection
  - Checkpoint System: checkpoints/ directory with versioned snapshots
  - Testing Shortcuts: scripts/test-shortcuts.ps1 with 9 commands

  ‚úÖ T2: Beta Safety Infrastructure (1 hour)

  - External Backup Script: scripts/backup-shopboss-beta.ps1 with compression & manifests
  - Restore Script: scripts/restore-shopboss-beta.ps1 with integrity validation
  - Backup/Restore Testing: scripts/test-backup-restore.ps1 for automated validation
  - Incremental Backup: scripts/incremental-backup-beta.ps1 for patch deployments

  ‚úÖ T3: Testing Documentation (30 minutes)

  - Testing Runbook: docs/TESTING-RUNBOOK.md - comprehensive testing procedures
  - Emergency Recovery: docs/EMERGENCY-RECOVERY.md - detailed recovery procedures
  - Beta Emergency: docs/BETA-EMERGENCY.md - beta-specific emergency protocols
  - Operator References: docs/OPERATOR-QUICK-REFERENCE.md - station-specific cards
  - Updated CLAUDE.md: Enhanced with testing handoff protocol

  üß™ What You Need to Test

  Please verify the following Phase T implementations:

  1. External Backup System

  - Check that backup location is set to C:\ShopBoss-Backups in Admin ‚Üí Backup Management
  - Test manual backup creation and verify files are saved externally
  - Verify backup compression and manifest generation

  2. Testing Scripts

  # Test the shortcuts work
  .\scripts\test-shortcuts.ps1 build
  .\scripts\test-shortcuts.ps1 status
  .\scripts\test-shortcuts.ps1 help

  # Test backup/restore cycle
  .\scripts\test-backup-restore.ps1

  3. SQLite Lock Cleanup

  # Test the cleanup script
  .\scripts\clean-sqlite-locks.ps1

  4. Checkpoint System

  # Test checkpoint creation
  .\scripts\test-shortcuts.ps1 checkpoint
  # Enter name: "test-checkpoint"
  # Enter description: "Testing checkpoint system"

  5. Documentation Review

  - Review docs/TESTING-RUNBOOK.md for testing procedures
  - Check docs/EMERGENCY-RECOVERY.md for recovery steps
  - Verify docs/OPERATOR-QUICK-REFERENCE.md for operator guidance

  üöÄ Next Steps

  Phase T is complete and ready for testing! The system now has:
  - Enterprise-grade backup/restore capabilities
  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure
  - Complete emergency recovery procedures
  - Operator training materials
  - Beta deployment safety systems

  Ready to proceed to Phase M: Manual Status Management when you're ready!
