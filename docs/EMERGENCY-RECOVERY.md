   # Stop and restart ShopBoss
   Get-Process -Name "ShopBoss.Web" | Stop-Process -Force
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
   .\scripts\test-shortcuts.ps1 run
   ```

4. **Monitor Performance**
   ```powershell
   # Check system status
   .\scripts\test-shortcuts.ps1 status
   
   # Monitor for 5 minutes
   ```

**Expected Recovery Time**: 5-10 minutes
